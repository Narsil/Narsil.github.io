|Mr. |Phileas Fogg| |li|ved|, |in |1|8|7|2, a|t |No. |7, |Saville Row|, |B|urlington|
|Gardens, |the| house| in wh|ich| |Sheri|dan| died in |18|1|4.  |He w|as on|e of|
the |most |n|oticea|ble member|s of the| Reform| Club|, |th|ough| he| s|eemed
|always |to |avoid |att|racting at|tention|; an en|ig|mat|i|cal |p|erson|age|,|
|ab|out whom l|ittle| was |known|, |e|xc|ept that |he| w|as |a |poli|shed m|an|
o|f |th|e |wo|rld|.  |Pe|ople sa|id| that h|e |re|sembl|ed| |Byron|--at least|
t|hat |his hea|d w|as |Byronic|; |but| he was |a |b|earde|d, tranquil| Byron|,
who| |might live| on a |thousand year|s |w|ithout g|r|owing o|ld|.|

|Certainly| an| English|man|, it |was |m|ore |doubt|ful w|h|ether |Phileas Fogg|
w|as |a |London|er|.  |He |was |n|ever |see|n o|n 'Change|, |nor |at |the |Ba|nk|,
|n|or |in th|e |co|unt|ing|-roo|ms of |the |"City|";| no| s|hips eve|r |came |in|to|
|London do|ck|s o|f which |he |was the |owner|; |he had| no| |p|u|bl|ic |em|ploym|ent;|
|he had n|ever |be|en |en|tered |a|t a|ny |of |the| |Inns| o|f |Court|, either| a|t |the |Templ|e,
or Li|n|coln's |Inn, |or |Gray|'s |Inn|; nor |had |his v|oice| |e|ver re|so|unded
|in the |Court| of Cha|nce|ry, |or |in the |Exc|hequer, or |the |Queen|'s |Bench,
or the |Ecc|lesiastical Court|s.  |He |certainly was n|o|t |a m|anufact|urer|;
n|or w|as h|e |a |me|rchant or a| gentlem|an |farmer.|  His name |was |stra|nge|
|to th|e s|cientific a|nd |l|earned |s|oci|et|ies|, a|nd |he |n|ever |w|as |know|n|
t|o |take| pa|rt in the |s|age| d|eli|bera|tion|s of the |Royal Institu|tion
o|r |the |Lon|don |In|stitution|, the A|rtisan|'s Ass|oci|ation|, |or the|
|Ins|titution| of| A|rts a|nd |Sc|ience|s.|  |He |belonged|, |in |f|act|,|
|to n|one of the n|umerous| s|oc|i|eties| w|hich |swarm |in the| |En|glish| capital|,
|f|rom the |Harmonic to th|at| of |the| |En|to|molo|g|ists, |found|ed |mainly
for the| purp|ose| of a|bolish|ing p|er|nicious |ins|e|ct|s.
|
|P|hileas Fogg| was |a m|em|ber| |of| the |Reform|, |and |th|at| w|as |all|.

|The| w|ay |in wh|ich| he |got |adm|issi|on| to th|is |ex|clusive| cl|ub|
w|as s|imple| en|ough|.|

|He |w|as |re|commended b|y |the Barings|, w|ith whom he had |a|n open c|redit|.
|His c|heque|s |were r|egularly p|a|id |a|t si|ght| from |his |a|cc|ount| |cur|rent|,|
|w|hich |w|as |a|lways |fl|ush.|

|W|as P|hileas Fogg| r|i|ch|?  |U|nd|oubted|ly|.  |But| |th|ose |wh|o knew him|
|best co|uld |not |imagine| how |he had |made |his |fo|rtune|, |and |Mr. Fogg|
|w|as |th|e| l|ast per|s|on |to |wh|om |to a|pp|ly |for the| |information|.  |He |was|
|no|t la|vish|, |no|r, on |the |co|ntrary, |avaricious; for|, |when|ever |he| k|new|
|that |money w|as |needed for |a |noble, |u|seful|, or be|nevolent| |purp|ose,
he |suppl|ied it| |quietly| |and s|ome|times| a|no|nymousl|y.|  He was|, in |short,
|the |least |co|m|muni|cati|ve |of |m|en|.  He |ta|lked |very| little|, and |s|eemed|
|al|l t|he more m|ysterious |for| h|i|s |ta|c|iturn| m|an|ner|.  |H|is dail|y |ha|bit|s
w|ere |qui|te o|pe|n| to obs|erv|ation|; |but w|hat|ever h|e did |w|as s|o |exa|ctly|
t|he s|ame |thing| that| he had |always |done| b|efore|, |th|at |the| wits
of |the curious we|re |f|airly pu|z|zled.|
|
|Had he t|rave|lled|?  |It was like|ly|, |for |no one| |seemed| to |know|
|th|e wo|rld |more |f|amil|iar|ly|; the|re was n|o sp|o|t s|o s|e|clud|e|d
th|at |he |di|d not |a|ppear |t|o h|ave |a|n i|nt|imate| a|cqu|aintance| with| it.
He o|ften c|or|rected, |with |a |few |clear wo|rds|, |the thousand| c|on|jecture|s
|a|dvanced |by |mem|ber|s of the| |c|lub| as |to| |lo|st a|nd unhe|ard-of travel|lers|,
p|ointing o|ut t|he| |t|r|ue p|robabilit|ies|, and |s|eeming |a|s |if |gi|ft|e|d with
a |sort of |sec|ond| s|i|ght|, |so often| did |e|ve|nt|s |justif|y |hi|s pre|diction|s.
|He |must have t|ra|ve|lled| every|where|, at |least in |the s|pirit|.

|It w|as |at least| |certain t|hat| |P|hileas Fogg| |had not |absented hi|m|self
from |London| for many y|ear|s.  |Those w|h|o w|ere |honour|ed by a better|
acquainta|nce| with h|im |tha|n the |rest|, d|eclared th|at| |no|body |co|uld|
p|ret|en|d t|o |have |ever |seen |him| |anywhere| else|.  H|is |s|ole |pasti|m|es|
|were |readi|ng t|he| |papers| a|nd |pl|ay|ing| |w|hi|st|.  |He |often |won at |th|is| |game|,
|which|, a|s a |si|l|ent on|e, ha|rmoni|sed| with |his |natur|e;| b|ut| |his wi|nning|s
n|ever w|ent |in|to |h|is |pu|rse|, b|e|ing |re|served| a|s |a f|und |f|or hi|s| c|ha|rit|ie|s.
|Mr. Fogg| |played|, no|t t|o |win|, b|ut |for |the| |sake of |playing|.
|The| |game |was |in |his |eyes| a |co|n|test, a| s|t|ru|ggle |w|ith a |difficulty|,
ye|t a |moti|onless|, |unwea|ry|ing |str|uggl|e, c|on|ge|nial t|o h|i|s t|astes.

|Phileas Fogg| was |no|t |know|n |to have |either| w|ife| |or |c|h|ildren,|
w|hich| |ma|y |happen| t|o th|e m|ost h|onest| people|; ei|ther rel|ative|s
or |near |fr|iends|, |whi|ch i|s |certainly |more| un|usual|.  |He |li|ved alone|
i|n |his |ho|u|se in |Saville Row|, |whi|th|er |no|ne pen|etrated|.  |A s|i|ngle|
domesti|c |s|ufficed |to |se|rve h|im|.  |He b|reakfast|ed |and |di|ned| a|t the cl|u|b,|
|a|t |ho|urs |ma|t|hematically |f|ixed, i|n the| s|ame room|, |a|t the sa|me| table,
|ne|ver |t|ak|ing |his m|eals| w|ith |other| m|e|mbers|, |m|uch| less |bring|ing|
|a gu|est with hi|m|; |and| w|ent h|ome at ex|act|ly |mi|d|night, on|ly| to re|tire|
|at |on|ce| to be|d.|  |He |never |u|sed t|he |cos|y |c|ha|mbe|rs |w|hich |th|e |Re|form|
|provi|de|s for |its fa|vour|ed| me|mber|s.  He |p|asse|d |ten |h|ours |out of the|
|tw|enty|-four |in |Saville Row|, |either| in sl|e|eping| o|r| ma|king |h|i|s toilet|.
|When he |ch|ose| to |take| a |wa|lk it w|as with| |a r|e|g|ular s|tep| in |th|e
|e|ntrance| |ha|l|l w|ith it|s |mo|s|aic| f|loori|ng|, or |i|n the |circu|lar |g|all|ery

|and |i|ll|umi|ned by b|lue |pai|nted |wi|nd|ows.  |Wh|en he breakfast|ed or |di|ned|
a|ll the r|esource|s| of the |cl|ub|--|it|s |ki|t|chens and pa|ntr|ies,
it|s b|utter|y |and |dairy|--|ai|ded t|o c|rowd |his t|able| with |the|ir| mo|st|
|succ|ulent |st|ores|; |he was |se|rved by |the g|r|ave|st w|aiter|s|,
in| d|res|s co|ats|, and |shoes w|ith| s|wan-s|ki|n s|o|le|s, |who| |proffered|
|the| vi|and|s |in sp|ecial |po|rcelain, and |o|n th|e f|i|ne|st| l|i|nen|;
|c|lu|b dec|anter|s, of| a l|ost |mould|, |co|ntain|ed hi|s |sh|err|y,|

w|ere refr|e|sh|ingly |co|oled with ic|e|, br|ought| a|t g|r|eat |co|st|
|fr|om |the American l|akes.|

|I|f t|o| live in th|is st|yle i|s |to |be |ecce|ntr|ic|, |i|t |must be|
c|onfessed that |the|re| i|s some|thing good in e|cc|entricity|.

|The| man|sion |in Saville Row|, |th|ough| not |s|um|ptuous|, |was| |e|xc|eeding|ly |com|fort|able|.
|The |ha|bits of |i|ts o|cc|upa|nt| were| s|u|ch a|s |to d|emand b|ut |little| f|rom |the
|sol|e |domesti|c|, but |P|hileas Fogg| re|quired hi|m t|o |b|e a|lmost su|perhu|m|anly
p|rompt| an|d regular|.  |On this very |2nd of |October| h|e |had dismi|ssed
|Jame|s Forste|r|, |because that |lu|ckless youth had b|rought |him| |shav|ing|-wat|er
|at |e|ight|y-four de|gre|es| Fahrenhei|t i|n|stead of eighty-|six|;
|and |he was |await|ing| his s|u|ccessor|, who| w|as |due| at |the |h|ou|se
between eleven |and half|-p|ast|.|

|P|hileas Fogg| |was |seated| s|qu|are|ly i|n |his a|rmcha|ir|, his feet cl|ose t|ogether|
li|ke those of a| gre|n|adier| on |parade|, |his hands| re|s|ting on hi|s |knees|,
|h|is b|ody strai|ght, h|is |h|ead| ere|ct; h|e was |st|eadily| w|a|tch|ing| a| |co|mpl|ic|ated
|cl|o|ck| which |indi|cated th|e |ho|u|rs|, |the |mi|nut|es|, the| se|cond|s, |the| |days|,
|the| |months|, |and |the year|s.|  A|t e|xact|ly ha|lf-past |eleven| |Mr. Fogg| w|ould|,
|a|cc|ording t|o his |d|aily h|a|bit, |quit| |Saville |Row|, a|nd repa|ir to |the |Reform|.
|
|A |rap at |thi|s m|oment| so|unded on the |door| of |the c|o|sy| |apart|me|nt| |where|
Phileas Fogg| |was |se|ated|, |and |James Forste|r|,| the d|ismissed| s|ervant|,| app|ear|ed|.
|
|"The new serv|ant|," |said |he|.

|A| young |man of th|irty| adv|anced |an|d |b|owed|.

|"You |are a |French|man, |I |believ|e|," |a|sked |P|hileas Fogg|, |"a|nd |you|r |name |is |John|?"

"|Jea|n, |i|f monsieur| please|s|," |replied the |new|come|r, "|Jean Passepartout|,
a sur|name which has |clung to |me be|cause I| have |a |na|tural| a|ptness|
|for |going |out| o|f o|ne| business |into |another|.  |I be|lieve |I'm hon|est|,

|"|Passepartout| su|its |me,|" responded |Mr. Fogg|.|  "|You |are |well |re|commended|
|to me|; I hear a |g|ood |rep|ort of |you|.  |You |kn|ow |my co|n|di|tions|?"

"|Yes|, m|onsieur."

"|Good|!  |What| t|ime is| |it|?"
|
"|Twenty|-t|wo |minutes after eleven|," re|turned |Passepartout|,
|drawing a|n e|normous s|ilver |w|atch| from |the |d|epths| of |h|is |pocket|.

"|You are t|oo| s|l|ow|,|" |said |Mr. |Fogg|.

|"|Pa|rdon |me|, m|onsieur|, i|t| is |impossible|--"

"|You a|re |four m|inute|s |to|o slow|.  |No| matter; |it|'s enough t|o |mention

t|h|is |We|dnesday, |2nd |October, you a|re |in my |s|ervice|."

|Phileas Fogg| got |up|, |took |his |hat in his |left ha|nd, |put| it |on|
hi|s |head |with| a|n aut|om|a|t|ic motion|, and w|ent |o|ff| |wi|th|out a| w|or|d|.

IN WHICH |P|ASSEPART|OUT| |IS |CO|NV|IN|CE|D |T|H|AT |HE H|AS |AT |LAST |FO|UND |HIS I|DEA|L


|"Faith|,|" |muttered |Passepartout|, |s|omew|ha|t f|lur|ried, |"I|'ve s|een people
at |Madame |Tussau|d's |a|s |lively a|s |my ne|w |m|aster|!"

|Madame |Tuss|aud|'s "p|eople|," let it |be said|, are of |w|ax|, |and |ar|e |much
v|isit|ed| in |London|; |spe|ech is| all th|at| |is |wanting| |to m|ake |the|m |huma|n.

|During his |bri|ef| in|terv|iew w|ith |Mr. Fogg|, |Pass|epartout| |had been|
|car|efully obs|erv|ing h|im|. | He app|eare|d to |be |a ma|n about |for|ty |y|ears| |of ag|e|,
|w|ith f|in|e, h|and|some| f|eature|s|, and |a t|all, w|ell|-|sh|aped f|ig|ure|;
|his hair and w|hiskers| were l|ight|, |his |forehead |c|ompact a|nd |unw|rin|kled|,
|his |face| |rather |pa|le, |his |t|eeth| magnificent|.  |His |c|ou|nte|nance |p|osse|ssed|
|in the| h|igh|est d|egree| wh|at p|hys|iogn|om|ists |c|all |"re|pose| in acti|on,"|
a| qu|ali|ty of those |wh|o act r|a|ther| tha|n t|alk|.|  |Calm and phle|gmatic|,
w|ith |a clear |e|ye|, |Mr. |Fogg |s|eemed| a| perfect type o|f th|at |English|
co|mposure| w|hich A|ng|elica| Kau|ffm|an|n h|as s|o s|ki|lful|ly re|p|rese|nted| o|n |ca|nvas|.
|Seen i|n the v|ari|ous |phas|e|s of h|is |dai|ly l|ife, |he gave |the| |idea of |being|
|per|fectly |w|ell|-ba|lan|c|ed, a|s |exactly r|eg|ul|ated |a|s a |Lero|y c|hro|nomete|r.
Phileas Fogg| was|, |indeed, e|xact|itude| per|son|ifi|ed|, |and th|is |was |be|trayed|
ev|en in the |expression of |his |ver|y h|ands| a|nd |f|eet|; for in m|en, a|s |well| as|
i|n a|nimal|s, the| |l|imbs t|he|mselves are e|xpre|ss|ive| of the |pass|ions|.
|
|He |w|as so |e|xact t|h|at |he was |n|ever in |a |hurry|, was |a|lways re|a|dy|,
|and |w|as |e|cono|mical al|ike of| his |steps |and h|is |motions.  |He n|ever |t|ook|
|o|ne |st|ep| t|oo many|, |and |always we|nt to h|i|s |destination| b|y the |s|horte|st| c|ut|;
he |made |no |super|fluous |ge|stur|es, |and |w|as n|ever |see|n |to |be m|ove|d |or |ag|itated|.
|He| |was t|he m|ost |deli|berate p|erson| in the |world|, y|et always |re|ached| h|is
destination| a|t the |exact| m|o|ment|.

|He |l|ived |a|lone|, |and|, |so| to| |s|peak|, o|ut|side |of eve|ry s|oc|ial| re|lation|;
|and |as he k|new |that |i|n th|is |wo|rld| |ac|cou|nt |m|ust be |t|a|ke|n |o|f f|ri|ct|ion|,
and| |that |fri|cti|on| re|tard|s|, |h|e |never |r|ubbed |against |any|body|.|

|A|s |for| |Passepartout, |he| |was |a |t|r|ue Pa|risian| o|f P|aris|. | Si|nce he|
had ab|andoned h|is own |count|ry| f|or E|ngl|and|, t|ak|ing |serv|ice| a|s a valet,|
|he had |in| v|ain| se|arched |for |a ma|st|er |after |hi|s own| h|ear|t.|
|Passepartout| w|as |b|y |no means |o|ne of those |per|t d|unce|s d|epicted| by|
|Mol|iere w|ith| a |bold |ga|ze a|nd |a |no|se| h|eld h|i|gh in the |air|; he was|
|an ho|nest f|ellow|, |with| a| pleasant |face|, |li|ps| a| trifle |protruding|,
|s|oft|-mannered |and |serv|iceabl|e|, |with| a good round |head|, |such a|s on|e
l|ike|s |to |s|ee| on the s|ho|ulder|s of a |friend|.  |His ey|e|s were| blu|e|,
|h|is |com|pl|exion| r|ubic|und|, |hi|s |f|igure| almo|st p|o|rtly |and well-b|uilt|,
|his |body |m|us|cu|la|r, |and hi|s |phy|sic|al p|owers f|ull|y de|veloped| by| the|
exercis|es| of his younger |days.|  H|is |br|own ha|ir| w|as somewhat |tumbled|;
f|or|, while the| |ancient| scu|lptor|s |are s|ai|d| t|o h|ave k|nown eighteen |methods
of |arranging |Mi|nerva|'s t|resses|, |Pa|ssepartout| |was |famil|iar| |with |but on|e of|
|dr|ess|ing |his own|: three st|r|okes of a| large|-to|o|th |co|mb c|om|ple|t|ed hi|s |to|ilet|.

|It w|ould be |ra|sh t|o |pr|e|dict |how |Passepartout|'s| |li|vely na|t|ure| would| agree|
|with| |Mr. Fogg|.  |It was |i|mpossible| to t|ell| |whe|ther |t|he n|ew |s|e|rvant
|would turn |out |as a|bsolutely methodical as h|is |ma|ster re|qui|red|;
ex|per|ienc|e| al|on|e co|uld |so|lve t|he |qu|estion|.  |Passepartout| had been|
|a so|rt o|f |vagr|ant |in |his early |year|s|, |and| |no|w y|ear|ne|d| f|or| r|ep|os|e;
b|ut so| f|ar he had |failed t|o |find |it, |though |h|e |had |already| s|erv|ed|
in t|en |En|glish |house|s|.  |But |he |could |not| take r|oo|t in a|ny of |t|he|se;
with |c|hag|rin, he f|ound hi|s master|s |inv|a|riab|l|y w|him|sic|al a|nd irregular|,
|con|st|ant|ly |running about |the| |cou|nt|ry|, |or o|n the |look-out| f|or| adventure|.
|H|is |last m|aster|, y|ou|ng| Lord Lon|gferry,| |M|ember o|f Par|l|iame|nt,
after passing |his n|ight|s |in the |Haym|ar|ket t|avern|s, w|as |too o|ften
b|rought |home| |in the |mo|rning| o|n |po|licemen's s|houlder|s.  |Passepartout|,
d|esirous o|f |r|e|sp|ecting| the| gen|tleman| who|m he served|, |ventured a| mild|
|rem|onstrance| |on |s|uch co|nd|uct; |which|, |be|ing |ill|-recei|ved|,| he |to|ok| his |l|ea|ve|.
H|ea|ring that |M|r. |Phileas Fogg| was |look|ing for| |a |serva|nt, |and th|at |his |li|fe|
was |on|e of |unb|r|oken| r|e|g|ula|rity|, |th|at |he n|ei|ther |tra|ve|lled| no|r |st|ayed
|from |ho|me| o|ver|night|, |he |f|elt sure that th|is would| be t|he| p|la|ce |he| |was| a|fter|.
|He |pre|sented himself|, |and |was |a|cc|epted, a|s h|as |been| seen.
|
|A|t |half-past |eleven|, |the|n, Passepartout |f|ound |himself| |al|one |in|

|Phileas Fogg|, |h|aving |s|hut |the |door of |hi|s |house| at h|alf|-past |eleven|,| and|
|h|av|ing p|ut his |right| fo|ot |before |his |l|eft f|ive |hundred| |and |s|even|ty|-fi|ve |times|, and h|is |l|eft| f|o|o|t

an| impo|sing |e|di|fic|e| in |Pall M|all|, w|hich| c|o|uld |not |have| co|st |less |than
th|ree mil|lion|s.  |He |re|p|aired a|t |o|n|ce t|o |the |d|ining-room|, |the |nin|e |w|indow|s
o|f |which o|pen upon a t|asteful |ga|r|den, wh|ere| |the| tr|ees| were |a|l|ready| g|il|ded|

th|e| |co|ver| of w|hich |had |alre|ady b|een |laid for| |him|.  |His |breakfast| |co|nsi|sted|

a| s|ump|t|uous| a|part|ment| |adorned| with |l|a|vis|hly-|framed| pai|ntings.
A fl|un|key hand|ed him| a|n| u|n|cu|t T|im|es|, which| |he pr|oceeded| t|o |cut
|w|ith| |a ski|ll w|hich |betrayed |f|amiliarity| with th|i|s |d|eli|cate| |operation|.
|The| pe|r|usal of th|is pa|pe|r ab|sorbed |Phileas Fogg| u|n|ti|l |a |quarter |before| |four|,|
w|hilst the |St|an|dard, his n|ext |task|, occ|up|ied hi|m| t|ill the| dinner| hour.
|Dinner passed as breakfast| had d|one|, and Mr. Fogg| re|-appeared| i|n |the|
|r|eadi|ng-room and s|at d|own to the |Pall M|all at |twenty| minutes |before| six|.
|H|a|lf an| hour |later |several |member|s of the Reform| c|ame |in| |and |d|re|w u|p|
|to the |fire|place, wh|ere a c|oa|l f|ir|e was |steadily b|urning.|
|They were |Mr. F|ogg|'s u|sual| p|ar|tners| a|t |whi|st|: Andrew |Stuart|, |an| engineer|;
|John S|ulliva|n| and Samuel |Fallen|tin|, |ban|ker|s|; |Thoma|s Flanagan|,| a b|rewer;|
|and |Gau|thi|er Ra|lph|, |one of the |Directors| of the |Ban|k o|f |England|--
|all r|ich and h|i|ghly re|sp|ectable| pe|rsonages, |e|ve|n i|n |a c|lub w|hich|
compr|ises |the |pr|inc|es of |English| tra|de and |finance|.

|"|Well|, Ral|ph," said |Th|omas Flanagan|, |"what |about t|h|at |r|obbery|?"

"|Oh|," replied |Stuart|, "th|e |Ba|nk |w|il|l l|ose t|he |mo|ney|.|"

|"On the |co|ntr|ary|,|" br|oke| in| Ralph|, "|I| hope w|e |may put |our h|ands|
on the r|o|bber|.|  Skilful d|etective|s ha|ve |been| |sent to all |the|

|"|But| h|a|ve you got |t|he ro|bber|'s desc|ription|?"| a|sked |Stuart.

|"|In |th|e first| place|, h|e |is no| r|o|bber| |at all|,|" re|turned |Ral|ph|, |p|ositi|vely|.

|"|Wh|at|! a |fellow| who ma|kes off| |w|ith| f|ifty-five |thousand| pounds|, |no| robbe|r|?"

"|No|."

"|P|erhaps he's a m|a|nufactur|er|, th|en|."

|"The| |Daily Te|legraph| say|s |t|ha|t |he is| a |g|entle|m|an|."

|I|t was |P|hileas Fogg|, |who|se head n|ow |e|merge|d| from be|hind| h|i|s |ne|wspa|pers, wh|o
|m|ade th|is |re|mark|.  |He |b|owed| |to |his f|riend|s, and |entered |into the c|on|versation|.
|The| a|f|fair which formed its subject, |and |which |was| t|own t|alk|, |ha|d occurred|
t|hr|ee d|ays| before| a|t |the| Bank| of England|.  |A |pa|ck|age| of ba|nknotes|, |to the|
value of f|ifty|-five |thousand| pounds|, |ha|d |been |taken from the |pr|inc|ipal
c|ashier's t|able|, th|at| fu|nction|ar|y |being| at |th|e |moment| e|ngaged| in regi|ste|ring|
|the |rece|ipt of |th|re|e shillings| an|d sixpenc|e|.|  |O|f c|ourse|, he |could not| |have|
|his e|yes| |every|where|.  |Let it| be |obs|erved that |the |Bank of |England| re|pose|s
a| |touching co|n|fidence| in the |h|onesty| of the |public|.  |There| ar|e |nei|ther| guards|
nor |gr|ati|ng|s |to protect| i|t|s tr|eas|ure|s|; |g|ol|d|, s|ilver|, |bank|notes| |are fr|ee|ly
e|xp|os|ed|, |at the |m|ercy of |the |fi|rst| co|mer|.  A| keen| observe|r of |English| c|ustom|s
|r|elat|es |tha|t|, |being i|n |one |of the| room|s of the |Ban|k o|ne day, h|e had |the
|curiosity to examine |a g|old |in|got| |wei|ghing| s|ome |se|ve|n |or| ei|ght |pounds|.
|He t|ook |it |up|, |s|crutinised| it, |passed| it| to hi|s ne|ighbour|, he |to |the next man|,
|and |s|o |on unti|l |t|he i|ngot|, g|o|ing from |hand| t|o h|and|, |was |t|ra|n|sf|erred| t|o the| e|nd|
|of |a| |da|rk| e|n|tr|y; nor |did |it re|turn to |its |place| |for| h|alf| a|n hour|.  |M|eanwhil|e,|
th|e c|as|hier| had not |so |much| a|s |raised h|is |head|.|  |But i|n |t|he |present in|stance
th|in|gs |ha|d not gone |so s|moothly|.|  |The p|a|ck|age of not|es| not| being |fou|nd wh|en
|f|ive o|'clo|ck |sou|nded |from th|e| |pond|erous cl|ock |in |the |"draw|ing off|ice|,|"
the a|mount was| |p|ass|ed to |the ac|co|unt| |of p|rofi|t| and |l|oss|.  |A|s |so|on as|
the| robber|y |w|as |dis|c|ove|red|, |p|icked de|tective|s |hastened| o|ff| t|o |Liverpool|,
|Gla|sgow|, |Havr|e, Suez|, |Br|indisi, |New |York|, a|nd |other| p|ort|s|, |in|spi|red| by|
the |p|roffere|d r|eward| of t|wo thousand |pounds|, |and| f|ive p|er| cent|.| o|n| the| |sum
th|at |m|ight be |re|covered|.  |Dete|ctives w|ere a|l|so |c|harged with| narrow|ly| watching
|th|ose w|ho |a|rrived| at |o|r l|e|ft |London| |by| rail|, |and |a| judici|al| exam|inat|ion
was |a|t |on|ce |e|n|ter|ed u|pon|.

|The|re w|ere |rea|l g|r|ounds |f|or s|uppo|sing, as| |the |Da|ily |Te|legr|aph| sa|i|d,
|that |the |t|hief did not |be|long| to |a pro|fessional band|.  |On| th|e day|
o|f the |ro|bber|y a| well-dre|ssed |gentlem|an| of po|lis|hed| |manner|s,
a|nd |with |a |well-t|o-|do| a|i|r, h|ad |be|en ob|s|erv|ed |going |to |and| fro|
in |the |paying| r|oom| where the| c|rim|e |was com|mitte|d.  |A| d|esc|ri|pt|ion|
of him was easily pr|oc|ur|ed an|d |sen|t t|o |the |detective|s; |and s|ome|
|ho|pef|ul |spi|rits|, |of wh|om |Ra|lph| wa|s |one|, did not |d|espair| of his a|ppre|hensi|on.
|The |papers an|d c|l|ub|s |were |f|ull |of th|e affair|, |and| e|very|where| pe|op|le| were|
dis|cus|sing the p|robabilities |of a |successful| p|ursu|it|; a|nd the |Reform| Club|
|was especial|ly |a|gitat|ed|, |seve|ral of |it|s |member|s |being |Ba|nk o|fficial|s.|
|
Ral|ph| w|ould not |co|nce|de th|at the| w|ork| of |the| |detective|s w|as |like|ly
to |be |in| v|ai|n|, |for he |thought| that| th|e pr|ize off|ered |would |greatly
|s|timulate |t|h|eir |zeal a|nd a|ct|iv|ity.|  |But |Stuart was far from s|ha|ring|
|t|his |co|nfidence|; and|, |as |the|y p|la|ced them|selves| a|t the| whist|-table,
they |cont|inued to |argue the |m|atter.|  |St|uart |a|nd |Flana|gan| |played t|o|gether|,|
|whi|le |P|hileas Fogg| had |Fallen|tin |fo|r |h|is |part|ner.|  |A|s |the game| |pr|o|ceeded|
the |con|versation| |cea|sed|, |except|ing be|tween |the r|ubber|s|, wh|en |it rev|ived |again|.|
|
|"I |m|aint|a|in|," said |St|uart, |"th|at the c|hance|s are |in| |favour| o|f the|
|t|hief, |who| must |be |a| sh|r|ewd f|ellow."

|"Well, |but |wh|ere| can he |fly t|o?|" asked |Ral|ph.|  "|No co|u|nt|ry| is| safe f|or h|im|."

|"|Ps|haw|!"|

|"|Where| c|ould |he g|o|, |th|en|?"

"O|h, I d|on't know| that|.  |Th|e |worl|d |is big e|nough|."

"|It |was on|ce," |said |P|hileas Fogg|, |in |a l|o|w |t|on|e.  |"C|ut|, |sir,|"
|he added, |ha|nding |the |car|ds| to |Thomas Flanagan|.

|The| |dis|cussion fell during |the |ru|bber|, |after |which| Stuart| to|ok up i|t|s t|hr|ead|.
|
|"|What| |do |you |mean| by |`once|'|?  |Ha|s |the| |world g|row|n s|m|aller|?"

"|Certainly|,|" |re|turned |Ra|lph|.  "|I| a|gree| with |Mr. Fogg|.|  |The| |wor|ld|

"|A|n|d als|o |w|hy the t|hief| ca|n |get away| |more |eas|ily."

"|B|e s|o g|o|od| a|s to |play, |Mr. Stuart|," said |Phileas Fogg|.

|But |th|e |in|c|redulous |St|uart| was no|t |conv|inced|, a|nd |when the|
h|and |was |f|inished, |said| eagerly|: |"You have a stran|ge| w|ay, |Ra|lph|,

|"I|n eighty |days|," |interrupted |P|hileas| Fogg|.

|
|"Th|is very |evening|?" |asked |Stuart|.

"|This very |evening|,|" re|turned |P|hileas Fogg|.  |He |took |ou|t| and|

|IN WHICH |PHILE|AS FOGG| |AST|OU|NDS |PA|SSEPART|OUT|,| |HIS |SER|VAN|T
|

|Having| w|on twenty| g|ui|n|eas |at w|hist|, |and |taken |leave of| hi|s |f|riends|,|
|Phileas Fogg|, |at t|wenty|-f|ive mi|nutes| |past |seve|n|, l|e|ft the| |Reform| Club|.
|
|P|assepartout|, wh|o had |conscient|ious|ly |studied| |the pr|o|gr|amme| of |his |d|utie|s,
was |more than |s|urpr|ised| t|o see| |hi|s |ma|ster| gu|i|lty| of the| in|exact|ness|
|of |a|ppearing |at th|is u|nac|customed h|our|; for|, a|ccording t|o |rule|,
h|e was |not |d|ue| in |Sa|ville Row| u|ntil prec|i|sel|y mi|d|ni|ght.|

|Mr. Fogg |repaired to |hi|s bed|room, |and called |out|, "Passepartout|!"

|Passepartout |did not |reply|.  |It |could not |be| he wh|o| |wa|s |ca|ll|ed|;
|i|t was |no|t |t|he r|ight| hour.|
|
"|Passepartout|!"| |rep|ea|ted |Mr. Fogg|, |with|out |r|ais|ing| hi|s v|oice|.

|Passepartout| |m|ade |his a|ppear|ance|.

|"I|'ve call|ed you tw|ice,|" observed |h|is |master|.

"|But| |it is |not |mi|dnight|,|" responded the |other, |showing |his| |wa|tch|.

"|I |kn|ow| it|; |I don't blame |you|.  |We| |start for |Dove|r| an|d Calai|s
in t|en minutes|."

|A |puzzled grin| overspread |Passepartout|'s |r|ound| |fa|ce|;
|clear|ly |he |had |no|t |com|prehended| his |master|.

|"|Mo|n|sieur is going| to |leave |ho|me|?"

|"|Yes|," re|turned |Phileas Fogg|.  |"|We| are going round |t|he| world|."

|Passepartout| |open|ed| |wide| |hi|s |eyes|, |raised his |eye|brows|,
|held up his hands|, |and |seemed |about |to |c|ol|la|pse|,|
s|o| overco|me w|as he |with |st|upefied| |a|stonis|hment|.

"|Round the world|!" he murmured|.|

|"|In eight|y |days|," responded |Mr. Fogg|. | "|So| we haven|'t a m|oment to| |lose|.|"

"|Bu|t the| tr|un|ks|?"| |gas|ped |Passepartout|, unconsciously| |swaying|
|his |head| from |right| to le|ft|.
|
|"|We|'ll h|ave |no| tr|un|ks|; only |a c|arpet-bag|, w|ith |t|wo| s|h|i|rts|
|and |th|ree pairs o|f st|ock|ing|s |for |me, |a|nd| t|he| same |for you|.
|We|'ll b|u|y |ou|r c|lothes| o|n |t|he |way|.  |B|ri|ng down |my m|ackintosh|
a|nd t|ra|vel|ing-c|loak|, |and |some s|to|ut s|ho|es, th|ough| |we |shall|
|do l|it|t|le |wa|lking|.|  M|ake| has|te|!"

|Passepartout| t|ried to re|ply|, but |co|uld not|.  |He |went o|ut|,
|m|ounted t|o |his own| room|, |fell |into a |c|hair|, and |muttered|:
|"Th|at|'s good|, th|a|t| is|!  |An|d I, who wanted t|o |re|main |quiet|!"|

|He |me|ch|anically |set a|bout ma|king the |preparation|s for departure|.
|Around th|e w|orld in eighty days|!  |Was h|is master a| f|ool|?  |No|.|
|Wa|s th|is |a |j|oke|, |th|en|?  |They |were |goin|g |to |Dover; g|ood|!
|To Cal|ais; good| |a|gain|!  |A|fter |all|, |Passepartout|, |who| had|
been |a|way |from |France| f|ive |years|, w|ould |no|t |be |sorr|y|
to |se|t foot |o|n |his |na|tive s|oil again|.  |P|erhaps the|y |would|
|go| a|s |fa|r as |Paris|, and |i|t |would d|o |h|is eyes |goo|d |to |see| |Paris o|nce| |more.
But sure|ly |a g|entlem|an so c|hary| |of his |s|teps |would |sto|p |there;| no| doubt|--
b|ut|, then|, |it w|as |no|ne the| less t|rue| |t|hat| he was| |going |away,|
th|is |s|o |do|mestic| p|erson| hi|therto|!

|By eight o'clock| |Pa|ssepartout| |had |pa|ck|ed the |mo|dest |c|arpet|-bag|,
c|on|t|ain|ing |the |ward|robes| of |his |master| and |himself|;| then|,|
|s|till |trou|bl|ed in |mi|nd|, |he |c|are|fully |sh|ut the |door| of |his |room,
a|nd |des|cend|ed to| Mr. Fogg|.

|Mr. Fogg| |was |qui|te ready|.  |Under |his |arm might have |been |observ|ed| |a |red-|bound
copy of |Bradshaw's |C|o|ntinent|al Rail|way| St|eam| Tr|ansit a|nd |General| |Guide,|
|w|ith its |timetables| |sh|owin|g th|e a|r|riv|al |a|nd d|e|parture| of |s|te|amer|s| a|nd railways|.
He took the| c|arpet|-bag|, op|en|ed it, |and |sli|pped |into| it a| |goodly| roll of|
|Ba|nk of| England| not|es|, |wh|ich |would |pass| w|h|erever |he |might |go.

|"You |have |fo|rgotten |not|hing|?" |asked |he.

|"Nothing, monsieur|."

"|My |ma|ckin|to|sh and |c|loa|k|?"|

"|Here| the|y are|."|

"|Good!|  |T|ak|e |th|is ca|rpet-b|ag|," |handing it |t|o Passepartout|.|
|"|Take go|od |care| of| it|, |for |th|ere| a|re t|wenty| t|housand| pounds| in it|.|"

|Passepartout| |nearly| d|r|op|ped| the |bag, as |if the| tw|enty| thousand| pounds|
we|re |in |go|ld|, |and |weighed |hi|m do|wn|.
|
|Mast|er |and man |then |de|scended|, |the s|t|reet-d|oor |was |do|uble|-|l|ocked|,
and a|t th|e e|nd of| Saville Row| the|y |took| a |c|ab |and |dr|ove| |rapidly
|to |Cha|ring| C|ro|ss.  |The c|a|b |st|opped be|fore| the r|ailway| s|t|ation
at twenty| minutes past |e|ight|.  |Passepartout |jump|ed |off| t|he |bo|x
and |follow|ed hi|s |ma|ster|, w|h|o|, |after |pa|ying |the| ca|bman,|
w|as |about to |en|t|er| th|e s|t|ation|, |wh|en |a |poor |begg|ar|-woman,
|with a c|hild in her| arm|s, her |naked f|eet |s|me|ar|ed with |mud|,
h|er he|ad| c|o|vered with |a |w|retch|ed| b|onnet|, fro|m which| |hu|ng a| tattered feath|er|,
|and |he|r s|hould|er|s| s|hro|uded |in a| r|agg|e|d |shawl, |app|roach|ed|,|
|a|nd |mour|nful|ly |asked for a|lm|s.

Mr. Fogg| |to|ok |out| the |tw|enty| gui|n|eas |he had |just| wo|n |at |whist|,
|and |h|and|ed |t|hem| to |the |b|eggar|, s|ay|ing|, "|H|ere, |my good| wo|man.|
|I'm glad |t|hat| I |met you|;" a|n|d p|assed o|n|.
|
|P|assepartout| |had |a m|oist se|ns|ation| a|bout th|e |e|ye|s|;
his |master|'s |act|ion| touched |his |suscepti|ble |h|eart.

Two first|-|class tickets f|or |Pa|ris h|av|ing been |spe|edily pu|rchased|,
|Mr. Fogg| |was |crossing the |st|a|tion| t|o the tra|in|, |wh|en he |p|erceived|
|hi|s |five |fr|iends of the |Reform|.

|"Well|, |gentlemen|," |said |he|, "|I|'|m |off|, you s|ee|; |and|, |if you|
w|ill exami|ne| m|y |passport whe|n |I |get| b|ack|, you| |will |be a|ble|
to |ju|dg|e w|hether I |have |acc|ompl|ished| th|e |jo|urney| |agreed upon|."

"Oh, |th|at w|ould be |quite un|necessary|, Mr. F|ogg|," |said |Ralph| pol|it|ely.
"|We |will |trust your w|ord|, |a|s |a g|entle|m|an of |honour|."

|"You d|o |not |forge|t w|hen you a|re |due| in |London| |again|?"|  asked Stuart|.

"|In |eighty |days|; on Sa|turday|, the |21st of |December|, |1|8|72,|
at a quarter| before nine| p.m.|  |Good-bye|, |gentlemen|.|"

|Phileas Fogg| and |his |servant| se|at|ed |the|m|selves| |in |a f|irst-cla|ss |carr|iage|
at |t|wen|ty| minutes |before| |nine|; five| minutes |later| th|e |wh|istle |sc|re|amed|,
|and |th|e |train| |slowly |gl|ided out |of th|e |station|.
|
|The| night was |dark|, |and a fi|ne|, |stead|y ra|i|n wa|s f|all|ing|.
Phileas Fogg|, |snu|gly e|nsconced |in |his |cor|ner, |d|id not o|pen his |li|ps|.
|Passepartout|, not yet re|covered |from his |s|tupef|action|,
|cl|ung |m|echanica|lly t|o t|he |c|arpet-bag|, w|ith |it|s |enormous |tr|easur|e.
|
|Just as |t|he t|rain |was |w|hi|rling| |through |Syd|e|nham,|
|Passepartout| sud|denly utter|ed |a| cry| |of |despai|r|.

|"What|'s the matter|?" asked |Mr. Fogg|.

"|Ala|s!| | In |my |hu|rry|--|I|--|I forgot|--|"

|"|What|?"

|"|T|o |t|ur|n |off| the gas| i|n my |ro|om|!"|

|"|Very well|, young| |ma|n," re|turned |Mr. Fogg|, |co|olly; "|it |will b|u|rn--|

|Th|is |was |Fix, on|e of the d|etective|s w|h|o had |been| |di|s|pat|ched| |from |England|

"|So |you |s|ay|, |consul," |asked |he| for| the tw|enti|eth time|, "t|h|at th|is |st|eamer|

Little by |l|ittle| |the |s|cene| o|n the |quay| became |more animated;
sailors of v|ari|ous na|tion|s, m|e|rchants|, |ship|-b|r|oke|rs, |porters|,| |f|ell|ahs,|

|As |he |p|assed among the| busy c|rowd|, |Fix, |according to h|abi|t,

"|And |does s|he go| |from |S|uez direct|ly| |to |Bombay|?"

"|Co|nsul,|" |said he, |w|ithout pr|ea|mble, "|I| ha|ve strong reasons

"|W|hy,| no|; |I |e|nte|red |his s|ervice| the very |day w|e |left London|."

|knew l|ittle o|r |not|hing| o|f his |master|, |wh|o |lived a s|ol|itary|

w|ould |not |land |at Suez|, |but |was |re|ally going |on| to |Bo|mbay|.

|"I|s |Bom|bay| far from her|e|?"| asked |Passepartout|.

|Did F|ix pay an|y |attention |t|o P|assepartout|'s |tr|ou|ble| a|bout| th|e gas|?
|It |is |not probable|.|  |He was |no|t |l|isten|ing|, but |was cogitating a| |pro|ject|.

"|But |are you not| |mistaken|?"

"I am |not| mistaken|."

"|W|hy w|a|s |th|is robber so |anxious| to |p|rove,| b|y |the vis|a,|

"|Wh|y|?  |I |have |no| idea|; but l|ist|en to me|."

He re|ported |i|n a| few word|s t|he |most |impo|rtant| |parts|

|
|"|In short|," said |the con|sul, "|app|earanc|es are w|hol|ly| |agains|t th|i|s m|an|.

|How| did th|is |e|ccentric |personage| pass| his| time |o|n the| Mongolia|? | He m|ade his|

for he had |found |pa|r|tne|rs| a|s enthusia|sti|c |in| the g|am|e |a|s |hi|mself|.
|A |t|ax-col|l|ector, o|n the |wa|y t|o his |pos|t |at |Goa|; t|he |Re|v. |Deci|mus |Smith,

|A|s for Passepartout, |he|, |t|oo|, had |es|ca|ped s|ea|-|sick|ness|, and to|ok| h|is |me|als
co|ns|cient|iously |in| the| forward |cabin.  |He |r|ather| e|n|joy|ed t|he vo|yage|,
|for |he was |well |f|ed and |w|ell |lodged|, |took |a gr|eat |interest| |in |th|e s|ce|nes
through |whi|ch |the|y |were| |passing|, |and |cons|oled him|self| with |the |del|u|s|ion

"|If I |am no|t m|istaken|," said |he, a|pproach|ing th|is |per|son,| |with| |his |mo|st|
|ami|able |smile|, |"you are the g|entleman wh|o| s|o k|indly |volunteered|

"|Li|ke| you|, t|o Bombay|."

"|Th|at|'s |c|apital|!  H|ave y|ou |made |th|is trip| before|?"

"|Se|veral time|s.  |I |am one of th|e |agents of the P|eninsular |Company|."

"|Then |you know| India?"|

"|W|hy| |ye|s," re|plied |Fix|, wh|o |spoke cau|t|iously.

|"|An|d |Mr|. |Fogg| is get|ting on |well|?"| |asked |Fix, |in |the |mo|st| |nat|ural|

"|Quite |well|, a|nd I |too.| | |I |eat |l|ike a f|ami|sh|ed ogre; |it's |the |se|a |air.|

"|But |I |never see |your| master| on |deck|."

|"|N|ever|; he| ha|sn't th|e least| |cu|rios|ity|."

|"|D|o you |know|, |Mr. |Passepartout|, |that |th|is| |pre|te|nded |tou|r |in| |eighty days|

|A|fter |this meeting|, |Passepartout |a|nd |Fix |g|o|t |into |the habit|

|Mr. Fogg |acc|ording|ly |t|a|ste|d the| dish|, but|, desp|it|e i|t|s |sp|i|ced sa|uce,

|Af|ter |wh|ich| Mr. Fogg| quietly| con|tin|ued| |his |din|ner.|  |Fix |had |go|ne|

not t|o lo|se |sight of |the |mysterious |r|ogue| |as |l|ong| |as |he stayed| in |Bombay|.
|He d|id not| |doubt| |for |a m|omen|t|, a|ny m|ore than Passepartout|, |that |Phileas Fogg|

|Phileas Fogg| |had |not |co|ncealed| from |Sir Francis| |hi|s d|esign of go|ing

|and th|e |general o|nly |saw in the| |w|age|r| a| useless| eccentricity

"|Bec|ause th|e |railway| s|topped| |at the |ba|se o|f the|se mountain|s|,

|"But|,| Mr. Fogg,|" |pu|rsued |Sir Francis|, "|you |run the r|is|k of|

|A|t ha|lf-past t|welve| |the tra|in stopped| at |B|urha|mpoor |w|here

|Passepartout| w|as |no|w |plunge|d in|to abso|rbing |reverie|.  |Up t|o|

|He |r|eco|gnised |hi|mself| |as |be|ing |per|son|al|ly i|n|te|rested i|n| the| |w|age|r,

|The| tra|in ent|ered the |de|files of the Sut|p|our |Mo|untains, |which |separate|
the |Khand|eish| from |Bundelcund|, t|owards e|vening|.  |The next day| Sir Francis|
|Crom|arty| a|sked P|assepartout| what |time| |it |was|; |to wh|ich|, on co|n|sulting|

|th|at |is| in |the |face |of th|e sun, |and t|h|erefore| the| days |were sh|ort|er
by |four |minutes| |for e|ach |d|egree| gone over|, Passepartout |obstinate|ly| re|fused|
|t|o al|ter| his wa|tch|, |whi|ch h|e k|ept |at |London| |time|.  |It |w|as| |a|n innocent| d|el|us|ion
|wh|ich could |ha|rm no| o|ne|.|

|The |tra|in |stopped|, a|t eight o'clock|, in| the midst of |a |glade| |som|e
|f|ifteen |miles |beyond |Rothal, |wh|ere |the|re| were |several| |bun|galows,

|s|ho|uted, |"|Passeng|ers| |will g|et |out |h|ere|!"

|Phileas Fogg |l|ooked |at |Sir Francis| Cromarty| |for| a|n explanation|;
but |the| gen|eral |co|uld |not| |t|ell wh|at| mean|t |a ha|lt in the mi|dst|
of |th|is |f|or|e|st| of dates and acacias|.

|Passepartout|, not |le|ss surprised|, |rushed out |an|d speedily r|e|turned|,| c|rying|:
|"|M|on|sieur, no| more| ra|il|way!"

"|W|hat| do you |m|ean|?"| asked |Sir Francis|.

"|I| mean |t|o |say |that |the |train| is|n|'t |go|ing on|."

|The |g|en|eral |a|t |on|ce st|epped| out, |whi|le Phileas Fogg| cal|mly| fo|llowed| hi|m|,
a|nd |th|e|y pro|ceed|ed |to|gether to the |c|on|ductor|.|

"|Wh|ere are we?" |asked |Sir Francis|.

"|A|t |t|he |ha|m|let| of |Kholb|y|."

"Do we s|top |here|?"

|"|Ce|rta|inly|.  |Th|e ra|il|way is|n't fini|sh|ed|."

|"|Wh|at|! |not| f|inish|ed|?"

"|No|.  The|re|'s |s|till |a m|atte|r |of |fift|y m|iles |t|o be |laid|

"|But |the| p|apers an|nounced |th|e o|pening of the |ra|il|way| th|roughout|."

|"Wh|at |would you |have|, o|fficer|?|  |The| |papers were |mi|staken|."

"|Yet| you |s|ell |tic|kets from |Bombay| to |Calcutta|," |re|torted |Sir Francis|,
|who| was g|ro|wing war|m|.|

"|No| doubt,|" replied |the |c|on|ductor|; "but |th|e| passenger|s k|now|
|that |the|y |mu|st |pro|vi|de| |means| of |t|rans|portation |f|or the|mselves|

|Sir Francis| wa|s |f|uri|ous|. | |Passepartout| w|ould| |w|illingly| have kno|cked
the| con|ductor| down|, and |di|d not |d|are to |look at |hi|s |m|aster|.
|
|"Sir| Francis|," said |Mr. Fogg| |quietly|, |"|we| will|, i|f you| please|,
l|ook a|bout |for| so|me me|ans of conveyance| to Allahabad|."

|"|Mr. Fogg|,| |th|is is a| d|elay |greatly to| y|our |d|isa|dvantage."

|"No|, |Sir Francis|; it |was |foreseen|."

|"|Wh|at|!  |You |knew that |the |way--"

"|Not a|t all|; |but |I knew |that some |obstacle| or other |wo|uld |s|oon|er| o|r l|ate|r

re|ach |Ca|lcutta |in |t|ime|.|"

|The|re was |no|thing |to |say| t|o |so |con|fide|nt a| |respon|se.

It w|as |but too tr|u|e that| the |r|ailway c|ame to |a t|ermina|tion at |this| point|.
|The| |papers were |like |some w|atche|s, |which |h|ave |a |w|ay o|f |gett|ing |to|o fast|,
and |ha|d |be|en |pr|em|ature| in| their an|nouncement |of the c|o|mpl|etion| of| the| l|ine|.
|The| gr|eat|er part |of the |tra|veller|s |were awa|re o|f t|his| inter|rupt|ion|,| and|,
l|eaving |the |tr|ain|, the|y be|gan to |en|gage |s|u|ch ve|hicles a|s the| v|illage

and |wh|at |not|.

Mr. Fogg| a|nd |Sir Francis |Cromarty|, |a|fter |se|arch|ing the |v|illage|
|from e|nd |to |end, c|ame |bac|k |with|out h|av|ing fo|und a|ny|thing.|

|"I |shall |go| afo|ot," said |Phileas |Fogg|.
|
|Passepartout|, |wh|o h|ad| |no|w |rejoined hi|s |ma|ster|, |mad|e |a |wry |gr|imace|,
a|s |he |thought| of |h|i|s |ma|gn|ificent|, |but t|oo frai|l Indian s|h|oes|.
Happily |he t|oo had |been |look|ing |about| him|, and|, |a|fter |a |moment|'s| h|esitat|ion,
|said, "|Monsieur, |I think| |I |have |found |a |me|an|s of conveyance|."

"|What|?"

"|An el|ephant|!|  An el|epha|nt| that |belo|ngs to a|n |Indian |who |l|ives|
|but |a |hundred s|teps| |from |here|."

"|Let|'s go| a|nd see |the elephant|," replied |Mr. Fogg|.

|The|y s|oon re|ached |a sm|all| hut, |near| w|hich|, en|closed |within|
|some |hi|gh |pa|ling|s|, was |the |an|imal in |qu|estion|.  |An |Indian ca|me
o|ut| of the hu|t, |and|, a|t the|ir re|qu|est, |con|du|cted them |with|in
the |en|closure|.  |The| elephant|, |which |it|s o|wn|er |h|ad re|ared|, |not |for|
|a be|ast of |b|urden|, |bu|t for w|arlik|e p|ur|p|oses|, |was |h|alf| domesticat|ed|.
|The| India|n |had |begun |al|ready|, |by |o|ften |irrit|at|ing| him|, and |fe|edi|ng|

h|owever, |f|or |Mr. Fogg|, |th|e a|nimal|'s in|st|ruction |in th|is |d|irection|
|had not g|one |f|ar, |and |the| e|lephant| st|ill| prese|rved| his na|tural|
|gen|tlen|ess|.  |Kiouni|--th|is |was the n|ame of the |be|ast|--c|ould|
|doubtless |travel rapid|ly |f|or |a l|ong |ti|me|, |and|, |in de|fault o|f|
an|y |o|ther |means |of conveyance|, |Mr. Fogg| resolved| to |hi|re |h|i|m.|
|But |el|ephants a|r|e fa|r from |c|heap in |I|ndia|, |whe|re they |are |beco|ming
scarce, |the |m|ale|s, |which |al|one a|re s|uita|ble for| circu|s |sh|o|ws,|
ar|e much |s|o|ught, e|sp|ecially| |a|s |b|ut f|ew of| the|m a|re domesticat|ed|.
|Wh|en |the|re|fore| Mr. Fogg |pro|posed| to |t|he |In|dian| t|o |hire Kiouni|,|
he |re|fused| po|int|-blank|.  |Mr. Fogg| p|ersisted|, o|ffering| the e|x|cess|ive|

Refu|sed.|  |Twenty pounds|?  Re|fu|sed also|.  Fort|y pounds?  |Still| re|fused|.
Passepartout| jump|ed a|t |ea|ch advance|; but the| |Indian| d|e|clin|ed| to |be |t|empted|.
|Yet| the| offer |w|as a|n allu|r|ing one|, f|or|, su|pp|o|sing| i|t| took| the| e|lephant
f|ifteen h|ou|rs |to reach |Allahabad|, |his |owner w|ould |r|eceive| |no| less |than|
si|x |hu|nd|red |pounds| s|t|erling|.|

|P|hileas Fogg|, with|out get|ting i|n |the |least| f|lu|rried, |then |pro|p|osed
|to |purchase| the| anima|l |out|r|ig|ht, |and |a|t |first| of|fered| |a t|h|ousand| pounds|
|for |him|. | |The |Indian|, |perhaps th|inking h|e w|as |going |to| make| a great| bar|gain|,
|st|ill |re|fused.

|Sir Francis| |Cromarty| |too|k |Mr. Fogg| a|side|, |and |begged h|im| to |re|flect|
|b|efore |h|e |went |a|ny |f|urther; |to wh|ich th|at| gentleman| rep|lied| |that|

and |that |he |w|ould |s|ec|ure| him |i|f he |had t|o |pa|y |t|wenty time|s his |v|alue|.
|Returning to the Indian|, |who|se |s|mall, s|harp eye|s, glis|ten|ing |with av|ari|ce|,
|betray|ed |th|at |with hi|m it| w|as |on|ly |a question |of |h|ow g|reat a| pri|ce|
|he| could obtain|.  |Mr. Fogg |of|fered| fir|st| twe|lve| h|undred|, |t|hen f|ift|een |hundred|,
|eighteen hundred|, |two |t|housand| |pounds|.  Passepartout|, usually |s|o rubicu|nd|,
was |fa|irly| w|hit|e |with suspense.|

|At t|w|o |thousand pounds| |the |Indian| y|ield|ed.

|"|Wh|at a p|rice|, good he|avens|!|" |cried Passepartout|, |"for |an |e|le|phant|.
|
|It |only re|mained |no|w t|o| find |a |gu|ide|,| which |was |comp|aratively |eas|y.
A y|oung |Parsee, w|ith| an| intel|lig|ent face, |offered hi|s s|ervice|s,

I|N WHICH |PHILEAS FOGG| |AND |HIS |COMP|ANI|ON|S
|VE|NT|URE| |AC|ROS|S THE |IN|DI|AN |FORE|S|TS,| AND |WHAT |EN|SUE|D|


|In order to| s|hor|ten the |journey|, |the |guide p|assed |t|o |the le|ft |of| the| |l|in|e
wh|ere the |railway| w|as |still in |pro|cess| o|f |be|ing |built|.  |Th|is l|ine|,
|owing to |th|e |c|apricious |turnings| of the |Vi|ndhia| |Mount|ains|,
d|i|d not pu|rsue |a| s|t|rai|ght| co|urse|.  |The| |Pa|rsee|,| w|ho |was |quit|e |familiar
w|ith the |road|s a|nd paths| |in the |distr|ict|, |declared| that| the|y would| g|ain
twenty| mi|les b|y |s|tr|iking |di|rectly t|hro|ugh the |fore|st.

|Phileas Fogg| a|nd |Sir Francis Cromarty|, |plunged| to |the |nec|k
in the |pecu|liar howdahs| pr|ovide|d |for |them|, |w|ere h|or|ribl|y |j|ostled
by the |swift t|rott|ing| of |the e|lephant|, |s|purred |o|n as |he| |w|as |b|y
|the s|kilf|ul |Parsee|; but| th|e|y en|dured |th|e d|is|co|mfort |w|ith| t|ru|e|
|Brit|ish p|hle|gm|, |talking li|ttle|, and scarcely |a|ble| to |catch |a glimpse
of ea|ch |other|.  |As for |P|assepartout|, |who| |was |mounted |o|n |the |b|ea|st's ba|ck,
and |re|ceiv|ed |th|e |d|irect| for|ce of |each |c|on|cussi|on| a|s| he |tr|od a|long|,
|he |was |very c|areful|, in |a|cc|orda|nce |with |his |master|'s |adv|ice|,
|to keep his |to|ngu|e from |be|tween h|is |teeth|, as |i|t |w|ould |oth|er|wis|e
have b|een |b|itte|n |off| sh|ort.  |The| |wo|rthy fellow |boun|ced |from|
|the |elephant|'s |n|eck| to hi|s |rum|p, and v|ault|ed li|ke a |clo|wn| |on a| sp|ring-board;
|yet| |he laughed |in |the |midst| of| |his |bou|ncing|, and |from |time| to t|ime| to|ok|
|a| p|iece |of |sugar| out of |hi|s |p|ocket|, and |in|s|erted| |it |in| Kiouni|'s tru|nk|,
w|ho re|ceived |it| with|out |in the least| slac|kening his r|egular tr|ot.
|
|After |t|wo hours th|e gu|ide| s|to|pped| |the |elephant|, |and |gave him|
a|n |hour |for |r|es|t|, d|ur|ing w|hich |Kiouni|, after |qu|enc|hing his |th|ir|st
|at| a| n|eig|h|bouring s|pr|in|g, |s|et t|o |de|vouring |th|e br|anches| a|nd |s|hrub|s
|rou|nd a|bout| |him|.  |Neither |Sir Francis| nor| Mr|. Fogg| r|egretted|
t|he| d|elay|, and| b|oth |des|cend|ed| with| |a |f|eeling o|f r|elief.|  |"|Wh|y|, he|'s|
m|a|de o|f |iro|n!|" |exclaimed| the general|, gaz|ing a|dm|ir|ingly |on| |Kiouni|.
|
|"Of| f|org|ed i|ro|n,|" |re|plied |Passepartout|, |a|s |he s|et |ab|out| |pr|epa|ring|
a |ha|st|y |breakfast|.

|A|t noon the |Parsee| g|ave |the |s|ignal| of d|eparture|.  |The| |country|
|s|oon |pre|sent|ed |a v|ery |savage |a|s|pect|.  |Cops|es| of d|ates |and|
|dwarf-pal|m|s |su|c|ceeded the d|ens|e |fore|st|s; |the|n |v|ast|, d|ry plains|,|
do|tt|ed |with |s|c|a|nty |shrub|s, and |sown| with| gr|eat |blocks| of| syeni|te.
|A|ll th|is |p|ortion of |B|undelcund, |whi|ch i|s l|ittle fre|quented|
by t|ravellers|, |is in|habite|d |by |a fanatical p|opulation|,
|har|d|e|ned in| the |m|ost |ho|rrible p|ractices of |the |Hin|doo |fai|t|h.|
|The| English have not |been |able| to |se|cure| |co|mplete| domini|on| o|ver|
th|is |territor|y, |whi|ch| is |s|ubjected t|o |the |inf|luence of |r|aja|h|s|,|
w|hom it |i|s almost |i|mpossible to |re|ach| in t|he|ir |inacce|ss|ible|
|m|ountain |fas|tness|es. |The| travellers| se|veral |t|imes| saw |bands|
of |ferocious |India|ns|, |who|, |wh|e|n |they |perceived| |th|e| e|lephant
|s|tr|i|di|ng |a|cross|-c|o|untry, |made a|ngry arid threatening| m|o|tion|s.|
|The| |Pa|rsee| avoided the|m as| much as possible|.  Fe|w| animal|s were|
observed on the route|; |even th|e |mo|nkeys |h|u|rr|ied from the|ir pa|th|
|w|ith co|nt|or|ti|on|s and gr|imaces| |which |c|o|nvulsed |Passepartout| with| l|aughter.
|
|In the midst| of his |gaie|ty|, however,| |on|e |th|ought |tr|ouble|d the| wo|rthy| |se|rvant|.
|Wh|at| would |Mr. Fogg |d|o |w|ith| |the |e|lephant| w|hen he got to| Allahabad|?
|W|ould he |carry h|im| on| wi|th| hi|m?  |Impossible|!|  |Th|e c|ost of tra|nsport|ing| |h|im|
|w|ould make| |him |ruin|ously expe|nsive|.  |Would |he sell hi|m|, or set| hi|m free?|
|Th|e e|stima|ble be|ast |certainly |d|eserved| so|me| co|nsidera|tion|.  |Sh|ould Mr.| Fogg
|ch|oose| to |make| h|i|m, Passepartout|, |a| pr|e|se|nt o|f |Kiouni|, h|e would |be |very |mu|ch|
embar|ras|sed|; and the|se t|hought|s |di|d not |cease |wor|rying hi|m |for| |a l|o|ng| time|.
|
|The| |p|ri|ncipal |chai|n of the |Vindhia|s| |was |cr|ossed b|y |eight in t|he e|vening|,
|and |ano|ther |hal|t |was m|ade| on th|e |northern slop|e, i|n a r|uin|ed b|ungalow|.
They |had |gone |nearly t|wenty|-five| mi|les |t|hat| |day|, a|nd| a|n |e|qu|al| d|i|stance|
s|till |s|eparated them| from th|e |station| |of |Allahabad|.

|The| night |was |c|o|ld|.  |The| Parsee| li|t a |f|ir|e in |the |bu|nga|low
|w|ith| a |fe|w dry| |branc|hes|, and |t|he| w|armth| was very g|ra|teful|,
|prov|i|sions| |pur|chased a|t |Kholby| s|ufficed |for |supper, |and |the|
|tra|vel|lers |at|e r|avenously|.|  |The| |co|n|versation|, |be|ginning |with |a fe|w|
|d|is|conn|ected phr|ases|, |s|oon| gave |place to |l|o|ud |a|nd |ste|ady s|nore|s.
|The| guide| w|atched Kiouni|, |wh|o |sl|ept st|anding|, |b|ol|st|ering |hi|mself
against |the |tr|unk of| a l|arg|e tr|ee|.  |No|thing| occur|red |durin|g |the|
nig|ht| to |dis|tu|rb |th|e slu|mberers|, |although |o|cca|sional grow|ls| fro|nt|
|p|anthers and |ch|att|er|ings of mon|key|s |b|r|oke| th|e s|il|ence|; |the |more|
f|ormidable be|ast|s ma|de| no |cri|es| o|r |ho|sti|le d|emo|nstrat|ion| against
|the occu|p|ant|s of |the |b|u|ngalow.  |Sir| Francis| |sl|ept |hea|v|ily|, l|ike a|n
|hon|est |soldier| |over|come with fatigue.|  Passepartout| was |w|rapped |in|
unea|sy dreams| of |the |bo|un|cing |of the |da|y| |before|.|  |A|s |for |Mr. Fogg|,
|he |slumbered |a|s peacefully |as i|f |he had |b|een| in |his |se|r|en|e mans|ion
|in |Saville Row|.

|The |journey w|as |re|s|umed a|t si|x |in |the mo|rning|; |the g|u|ide| |h|ope|d|
t|o rea|ch |Allahabad| b|y |evening|.  |In th|at c|ase, |Mr. Fogg w|ould o|nly|
|lose |a |par|t of |the f|orty|-eight |hour|s| |saved si|nce |th|e begin|ning|
of the t|our.  |K|iouni|, |re|suming| his |r|apid gait|, s|oon |des|cended|
the| |lo|wer |sp|ur|s of |the |Vin|dhia|s,| a|nd |t|ow|ards noon| the|y |passed
by th|e |vi|llage| of |Kal|le|nger|, o|n the |Cani|, |on|e of the |branch|e|s
of |the |Ga|nges|.  |The |g|uide| avoide|d |inhabited |pla|ces|, t|h|inking |it |safer
t|o kee|p |the |open country|, w|hich |lies |al|on|g the |first| d|e|pr|ess|ion|s
of the basin |of |the| g|r|eat r|iver.|  |A|llahabad was |no|w only |t|welve |mile|s|
to |the north|-e|ast|.  |The|y |stopped |under |a |clu|mp| o|f |ba|nanas|,
|the| |fruit| o|f which|, a|s |he|al|thy |as brea|d |and |a|s s|uc|cule|nt |as| |cr|ea|m|,
was a|m|pl|y partake|n of |a|nd a|ppr|eciat|ed|.

|At |t|wo o'clock| the| gu|ide| entered a thi|ck f|or|est| w|hich e|xt|end|ed|
several mi|les|; |he preferred to t|ravel |under |co|ver| of |the| w|ood|s|.
|The|y had |not |as yet |had |an|y unp|lea|sant e|ncounte|rs|, |and the |jour|ney|
|s|ee|med |on |the p|oint of |being |suc|cess|ful|ly |accomplished|, whe|n the|
e|lephant|, |beco|ming r|estles|s, |s|udd|en|ly s|topped.

|It was |then |fo|ur| o|'clock|.

|"What|'s the |matter|?" |asked |Sir Francis|, pu|tting |out |his h|ead|.

"|I |don't |know|, |off|icer|," replied| the |Pa|rsee|, |list|ening| at|tenti|vely|
t|o a |confused |mu|rmur| |which came |through the |th|ick| b|ranches|.|

|Th|e |mur|mur s|oon |became |more di|st|in|ct|; |it no|w |seemed| like |a |dist|ant|
|con|cert |of |human v|oice|s| a|ccompanied| by |bra|ss |in|strument|s.|
|Passepartout |was| a|l|l ey|e|s |an|d |ear|s.  M|r. Fogg p|atiently|
|wa|ited |with|out a |word|.  |The |Parsee| ju|mped |to th|e |ground|,|
|fa|stened |the elephant| to| a |t|ree, a|nd |pl|unged into| the |thicket|.
He |soon returned|, |sa|ying|:
|
|"A| p|ro|cession| of |Brahmin|s| is |c|om|ing |th|is way|.  |We |must |pr|event|
|the|ir |se|eing |us|, |i|f possible|."

|The| g|uide| u|nloose|d |th|e |e|lephant| a|nd |led |h|i|m |in|to |a |thi|cket|,|
a|t th|e s|ame time |askin|g |the |tr|a|vellers| no|t| to |stir|.  |He |h|eld| himself|
|re|ady to |bestride |the |an|imal| |at |a moment|'s |notice|, |s|hould |fl|ight
become |necessary|;| but| he evidently |thought| th|at| th|e pr|o|ce|s|sion|
of |th|e |fai|thful w|ould |pas|s w|ith|out |per|ceiving| t|he|m amid|
the |thic|k f|oliage|, |in |which |the|y w|ere| |whol|ly c|on|cealed|.

|The d|iscord|ant t|ones| of |the v|oice|s and |in|struments| dr|e|w n|ear|er,|
and |no|w |droning |songs min|gl|e|d with th|e |sou|nd of t|he t|ambourines |and cymb|al|s.
|The| h|ea|d |of| the| |p|ro|cession| s|oon |app|eared| be|neath the| t|ree|s|,
a| h|undred |pac|es a|way|; |and |the |strange| |f|igure|s |wh|o performed th|e| r|eligi|ous
ce|r|emony w|ere ea|si|ly d|is|tinguish|ed| th|rough| the| br|anch|es|.|
|Fi|rst ca|me| |the |pr|iests|, |with |m|itres on |their |head|s,|
|and |cl|o|thed in lo|ng l|ace| |robes|.  |The|y |w|ere |surroun|ded |by men,|
women, |and ch|ildren|, wh|o s|ang a |kind| of l|u|gubrious p|sal|m,|
i|n|te|rrupted a|t| r|eg|ular| |in|terval|s| by |the tambourin|es| |a|nd cymba|l|s|;
|whi|le be|hind| the|m w|a|s |dra|wn| a| car w|ith |large wh|eels|,|
|the |s|p|okes of which |r|epr|esented |s|er|pents| |en|twined| with e|a|ch other|.
|Upon t|h|e |car|, which |was |d|ra|wn by| |four r|ich|l|y| c|apar|isoned| ze|bus,
s|t|ood a h|ideo|us |st|atue| with f|o|ur arms|, |the| b|ody co|loured |a |du|ll |r|e|d,
with |h|aggard| eyes, |dish|evelled| h|ai|r, |pr|ot|ruding t|ongue|, |and| |l|i|ps| |tint|e|d
|with |bet|el.  |It s|t|ood up|right upon the |fig|ure of a| |pros|tr|at|e
a|nd he|adle|ss giant.
|
|Sir Francis|, re|cognising the s|ta|tue|, |wh|ispered|, |"The g|oddess |K|al|i|;
the| |go|ddess of l|ove| and |de|ath|."

|"Of |de|ath|, |perh|aps|," muttered back Passepartout|, "|b|ut of |love|--
th|at ugly old |hag?  |Never|!|"

|The |Parsee| ma|de a motion| |to |keep| si|lence|.

|A group| of old| |fa|kir|s| were| |capering an|d m|a|king a |wild |ad|o |round |the |st|atue|;
these| were |str|i|ped w|ith |o|chr|e, and cover|ed| with |c|uts |wh|ence t|he|ir| bloo|d
|i|ssued |dr|op| by |dr|op|--|st|upid f|anatics|, who, |in th|e gr|eat Indian |cerem|onies|,
st|ill |thr|ow |the|mselves| under the |w|heels| |of |J|u|ggernaut.|  |Some| |Br|ahmin|s,
|clad |in |all th|e |s|umptuous|ness o|f |Oriental a|ppare|l, |and| lea|ding |a |woman
who| fal|ter|ed at |every step|, |f|o|llowed|.  |Th|is woman was young|, and a|s
|f|air as a European.  |He|r |h|e|ad a|nd neck, |shoulders|, |ears|, |arms,|
|hands|, and t|oes| were |loaded |down |with |j|ewels| and g|ems| w|ith| bra|ce|let|s|,
|e|ar|rings, |and |r|ings|; while |a t|unic b|ordered| with |gold|, |and |cover|ed|
with| a |li|ght mus|l|in robe|, |be|tray|ed |the| |outl|ine of h|er |f|o|rm|.

|The gua|rd|s| w|ho |f|oll|owed |th|e young woman| pr|esen|ted |a| v|iol|en|t contr|ast|
t|o her|, arm|ed |as |the|y |were| |with n|a|k|ed s|a|bres| hun|g |at |the|ir| |waist|s,
|and l|ong |dam|asce|ned pis|tols, and |be|aring |a| co|r|ps|e| o|n |a |palanquin.
|It was |the| b|ody o|f a|n old| m|an, |gorg|eously ar|rayed| in |the |habiliment|s
|of |a ra|jah|, w|ear|ing, a|s in l|if|e, a| turban e|mbroidered with p|earls|,
a| |r|ob|e of |tiss|ue| of| s|ilk a|nd g|old|, |a| sc|ar|f of ca|s|hmere s|ewed with| |d|iamond|s,
and |the |magnificent| w|eapons |of a| |Hind|o|o| prince|.|  |Ne|x|t c|ame |the |musicians|

S|ir |Francis wa|tched the pr|o|ce|ssion |with |a |s|ad c|ount|enance|, |and|,|
|tur|n|ing to the guide|, |said|, "A| sutte|e|."

|The Parsee| n|odd|ed|, |and put| his |f|inger |to h|is |lips.|  The| p|ro|ce|ssion| s|low|ly|
w|ound under th|e |tre|es|, |and |soon i|t|s |la|st r|a|nks| dis|appear|ed| in t|he| |depths|
of |th|e |wood|.  |The| songs |gr|a|dually |died |away|; o|cc|asional|ly c|ri|es| w|ere h|eard|
in the d|istance|, un|til a|t |last all was |s|ile|nce a|g|ain|.|

|Phileas Fogg| |had |heard| w|hat |Sir Francis| s|aid|, |and|, |as so|o|n as|
|the |pro|cession |had |d|isappeared|, asked|: |"W|hat| is |a su|ttee|?"

"A s|uttee,|" |returned |the |gen|eral|, |"i|s a |human |sa|crifice, |but a| v|olu|n|t|ary o|ne.
|The| w|oman| you |ha|ve |just seen |will| be |burn|ed| t|o-morrow| at the |da|wn| o|f |day|.|"

"|Oh, |th|e |s|cou|ndre|ls|!"| |cried |Passepartout|, |who| |co|uld| not| |re|pr|ess
|hi|s indi|gnation|.

|"And |th|e co|rps|e?" |asked |Mr. Fogg|.

"|Is |t|hat |of the |pri|nce|, her| hu|sba|nd|," |said |the guide|; "|an |indepen|dent|
|ra|jah of |Bundelcund|."

|"|Is |it |p|ossible|," re|s|umed |Phileas Fogg|, |h|is voice be|traying |n|ot|
t|he |least e|motion|, "t|hat |the|se b|arb|arous cu|stoms s|till e|xist| in| India|,

"|These s|acrifice|s |do not occ|ur in the l|arger| portion| of India|,"
re|pl|ied |Sir F|rancis|; "but we |have no| |power o|ver| t|he|se| s|avage t|erri|tori|es|,

"|The| poor w|r|etch|!" exclaimed Passepartout|, |"|to be burn|ed| ali|ve|!"

|"Yes|," re|turned |Sir |Francis|, "|bu|rned |alive|.  |An|d|, |if she were no|t|,

|Wh|ile Sir Francis |wa|s |sp|eaking|, |the guide| |s|ho|ok |his head| se|veral |time|s|,

|"|How do| you know|?"

"|Everybo|dy |kno|ws about |this| aff|air i|n |Bunde|l|cund|."

"|But| th|e wretched| cr|eature| did not |seem t|o b|e |making |an|y re|si|stance|,|"
|observed |Sir Francis|.

"|That| w|as |beca|use |the|y h|ad| |in|toxicated her with f|u|mes| of hemp and opi|um|.|"

|"|But| wh|ere |are |the|y tak|ing he|r?"

"T|o-m|o|rrow|, at |the |first| l|ight of |da|wn|."

|The| |guide| |no|w l|ed |t|he| |elephant| ou|t |of |the |thicket, and| |l|ea|ped| up|on| |h|is neck.
|Just at th|e |moment| that |he w|as a|bout to| |urge |Kiouni| for|ward| with |a |peculiar|

IN WHICH |P|ASSEPART|OUT| |RECEI|VE|S |A |NEW| P|R|OOF
|THAT |FO|RT|UN|E| F|AV|ORS |TH|E |BRA|VE
|
|
|The pro|ject was a |bold o|ne, f|ull o|f d|ifficult|y, |perhaps| impracticable.
|Mr. Fogg| was |going |to |ri|s|k |life|, or |at least| l|i|berty|, and |the|refor|e|
t|he s|uc|cess |of h|is tour.  |But| he d|id not| |hesitate|, and he| |found| i|n
|Sir Francis |Cromarty| |an enthusiastic| ally|.|

|As |for |Passepartout, |he| was |ready f|or| a|n|ything| that m|ight be |pro|posed|.
|H|is master|'s i|dea cha|r|m|ed him|; he |perceived| a h|eart|, a| |so|ul, un|der t|hat|
|icy exterior|.  |He |beg|an to |love| |P|hileas Fogg|.
|
|The|re| re|mained| t|he |g|uide|: what course |would |he a|dopt?  W|ould |he|
|not take |part |with the |Indian|s|?  |In de|fa|ult |of h|is |assist|ance|,
|it was n|e|cessary| to |be |a|s|sured |of| hi|s |n|eut|ral|ity.

|Si|r Francis |fran|kly |put the |question |to| h|im|.|

|"|Of|ficers,|" replied |the g|uide|, "|I |am |a |Parsee|, a|nd |this |woman| i|s |a Parsee|.
|Comm|an|d me as |you w|ill|."

|"Excellent!"| |said |Mr. Fogg|.

|"|However|," |re|sumed the| guide|, "|it is |certain|, not o|nly |that|
w|e shall |risk ou|r l|i|ves|, |but h|or|rible |tortures|, |i|f |we |are |tak|en|."

"|That is| for|eseen|," replied |Mr. Fogg|.  "|I |think| we |must wait| ti|ll n|igh|t
b|e|fore a|cting|."

|"I| think| |so|," |said |the guide|.

|The |wor|thy |Indian| t|h|en |g|ave |some |a|cco|unt| of |th|e |v|ictim|, |wh|o,
|he s|aid|, |was a| |celebrate|d b|eau|ty of the |Parsee r|ace|, |and the|
d|a|ughter |of a |w|ealthy B|ombay| merchan|t.  |She |had received| |a
|th|orough|ly E|nglish| e|ducation| |in| th|at c|it|y, |and|, |from h|er |m|ann|er|s
|and int|elli|gence, |would be thou|ght| a|n |European|.  |He|r |name was |Aouda|.
|Le|ft |a|n o|rp|han|, s|he |was |ma|rr|ied against| |h|er w|i|ll |t|o |the| |o|ld |rajah|
o|f Bundelcund|; |a|nd|, knowing the f|at|e |that |awa|ited| h|er|, she e|scaped|,
w|as |re|tak|en|, a|nd |d|evoted by the ra|jah|'s |re|l|ati|ves|, w|ho| |had| |a|n i|ntere|st|
|in |her d|ea|th|, |to |the |sacr|ifice| f|rom which| it| |s|eem|ed she co|uld not |escape|.
|
|The |Parsee|'s narr|ativ|e on|ly co|nfirmed Mr. Fogg| a|nd |his companion|s|
|in| the|ir gener|ous |des|ign|.  |It |was |decided| t|h|at the guide| should |di|re|ct
|the e|lephant| |tow|ards the p|agoda| of Pillaji|, |which| |he |ac|cording|ly| |app|roached|
|as qui|ckly a|s |possible|.  |The|y |ha|lted|, half an h|our a|fter|ward|s|,| in a co|pse|,
|so|me |f|ive |hundred |fee|t |from the |pagoda|, where |they |were| |well con|cealed|;
but the|y |c|ould |hear |the| groans |and |c|ri|es| of |the |f|akirs| di|stinctl|y|.
|
|The|y |the|n |discusse|d the |mean|s |of getting |at the v|ictim|.  |The| g|uide|
|wa|s familiar with the |pagoda| of Pillaji|, |in which|, a|s |he |declared|,
|t|he |young woman| was |impri|son|ed|.  |Co|uld |they enter a|ny |of i|t|s doors|
while |th|e w|h|ole party |of |Indian|s| was |plung|ed in| |a| |dr|u|nke|n| slee|p,|
or was |it safer |to |atte|mpt |to |make |a hole| |in the |w|alls|?
|Th|is |co|uld |o|nly |be dete|rmined| at t|he |mom|ent| an|d the |pla|ce |t|h|e|mselves|;
b|ut |it |was |certain t|hat |the |abduct|ion| m|ust| be |made| th|at| night|,
|and |no|t |wh|en|, |at b|reak |of day|, the| |vi|ctim| was |le|d t|o |her |funeral p|yre|.
|The|n |no| hu|man |inte|rvention |co|uld |save |he|r|.

|As soon as |night| f|e|ll|, |a|bout six o'clock|, th|e|y d|e|cided to make|
a |re|co|nna|issance| around| the |p|agoda|.|  |The| cries of the f|akirs| |were|
|just |c|ea|sing|; the |Indian|s w|ere |i|n the act o|f |plu|nging| |the|mselves|
|into |th|e |d|ru|nkenn|ess| c|a|used| b|y |liquid |opium| mingle|d with |h|emp,|
|and |i|t m|ight |be| |poss|ible t|o |slip| be|tween |the|m |to |the temple| i|ts|elf|.|

|The| |Par|see|, l|eading the |other|s, |no|iselessl|y |crept| |through the| |wood,
and in| t|en minutes| |th|ey |found| the|mselves| |on |the |b|ank|s of |a| |sma|ll| str|eam|,
when|ce|, |by |t|he| l|i|ght| of |the |ros|in torch|es|, |the|y p|e|rceived| |a p|yr|e of |wo|od|,
|o|n |th|e |top| of| which| lay| t|he e|mba|lmed bo|dy |of the |ra|jah|, wh|ich| was| |to |be|
|b|urned with| hi|s |w|if|e.  |Th|e p|agoda|, w|ho|se minar|ets l|oo|med abo|ve t|he |tr|ees
|in th|e d|ee|pening d|usk|, |s|tood |a hundred |steps| away|.|

|"Co|me|!" |whi|spered the |guide|.

|H|e |slipped| |more| ca|utiously |t|han ever| through the| br|ush|,|
|fo|llow|ed by his |c|ompanion|s; th|e s|ilence a|round |was |on|ly br|oke|n|
|by t|he |low| m|u|rmuring o|f| the wi|nd| a|mong |the b|ranches|.

|So|on| the |Parsee| st|opped| on |the bo|rd|er|s of the gl|ade, w|hich |was| |lit| up|
b|y th|e |to|rches|.  |The| |gr|ound| |was |co|vered |by gr|oups of |the| |Indians,|
m|otionles|s| in the|ir |d|runken |s|leep|; i|t |seemed |a |battl|efie|ld stre|wn|
|with |the| |de|ad.|  |M|en|, w|omen, |and children| l|ay| t|oge|ther|.

|In the |ba|ckg|round|, a|mong the |tre|es, |the| pa|goda o|f |P|illaji|
l|oome|d d|is|tinctly|.|  |Much |to |the| guide|'s |disappointment|,
th|e |guards of the r|ajah|, |l|ighted by to|rches|, were |watching|
a|t |the |doors| a|n|d m|arching |t|o |a|nd |fro |with |naked s|abre|s|;|
p|roba|bly |t|he |p|ri|ests, |t|oo|, |were wa|tching| |with|in|.

|The |Parsee|, |now con|v|in|ced| |that it w|as |impossible| to |fo|rce|
a|n| en|tran|ce t|o |the |temp|le|, a|dvanced |n|o| f|arther|, |but| l|e|d h|is|
companions| |b|ack| |again|.  |Phileas Fogg| and |Sir Francis| |Cromarty|
|also |saw that |nothing |cou|ld be| attempted| |i|n th|at| direction|.
|The|y |stopped|, a|nd |e|ngaged |in |a |w|hisp|ered |coll|oquy.|

|"|It |is |only |eight| |now|," |said |the b|r|ig|ad|ier|, "a|nd the|se| gu|ards
m|ay |also go to |sl|ee|p|."

|"|It is |not |impossible|," re|turned |the |Pa|rsee|.
|
Th|e|y |lay down at |t|he |fo|ot of a |tr|ee, a|nd waited.|

|The |time |se|emed |long|; |the g|uide |ev|er and a|no|n |le|ft the|m|
|to t|ake an| obs|erv|ation| |on |the |ed|ge| of the w|ood|,| b|ut the g|uards|
w|atched |st|eadily b|y the |g|lar|e |of the |to|rches|, and |a| d|im |light
|c|re|pt through the| w|indows of the| |pagoda|.

|Th|ey |waited| till m|idnight|; |but| no| change |took |place |among |the| gu|ards|,
|and| |it |became |a|pp|arent that their y|i|eld|ing to s|l|e|ep| cou|ld not| be| |cou|nted| on|.
The |other pla|n |must be |ca|rr|ied o|ut|; an| o|penin|g in the| wa|lls| of |the| pa|goda|
|mu|st| |be |ma|de|.  |It |re|mained to as|certain whe|ther| the p|riests were |w|atch|ing
by the |sid|e| of the|ir v|ictim| |as as|sidu|ousl|y as were |the s|old|iers| a|t the |door|.
|
|After |a |l|ast c|on|sultation|, the guide a|nnounced th|at| |he was |rea|dy|
|for| the attempt|, a|nd |a|dvanced|, |followed| by the |other|s|.  |The|y to|ok|
a |r|oundabout| |way|, |s|o a|s to g|et |a|t |the |pa|god|a| o|n |the |rear|.|
|The|y |rea|ched th|e |wa|lls |about h|alf-past tw|elve|, with|out h|aving met an|yo|ne|;
h|ere| there |was |no| guard|, |nor we|r|e| t|here| |either win|dows or d|oors|.

|The |night was |dark|.  |The| moo|n|, o|n the |wane|, s|car|ce|ly l|e|ft the |horizon|,
a|nd |was |co|vered |with| |he|avy |cl|ouds|; the h|e|ight of |the| |tr|ee|s| d|eep|en|ed|
the| |d|arkness|.

|It was |no|t e|nough to reach the w|alls|; |an| o|pening |in| t|he|m mus|t
be |a|cco|mpli|shed|, and |to| att|ain |th|is p|ur|pose| the |p|art|y| on|ly had|
t|h|eir pocket|-k|nives|.  H|appi|ly| the| temple w|alls were |bu|ilt| of brick
and |wo|od, |which co|uld |be |pe|netrated| with |l|it|tle |difficult|y;
|after one |bri|ck |ha|d |been |t|aken |o|ut|, the |r|est w|ould yield| e|as|ily|.
|
|The|y |set no|isele|ssl|y to w|ork, and |the| |Parsee |on| o|n|e s|ide
|and |Passepartout| o|n th|e other| b|eg|an to l|oosen the |b|ri|cks
|so| |as to |make |an| aperture| two |feet| |wide|.  |They |were |ge|tting| o|n r|a|pidly|,
|when |suddenly |a |cry wa|s he|ard in the int|erior |of th|e |temple,|
|f|o|llowed| almost in|stantl|y b|y |other cr|ies| |rep|l|ying| f|rom |the |outside|.
|Passepartout a|nd the guide| s|topped|.  |Had the|y |been| heard|?  Wa|s the|
|al|a|rm b|eing given|?  |Common| pru|dence| u|rged the|m to re|tire,| a|nd |the|y
di|d |so|, |fo|llowed by |P|hileas Fogg| a|nd |Sir Francis|.  |The|y |ag|ain h|id
themsel|ves in th|e wood|,| and |w|aited| t|ill t|he| d|ist|urbance|, wh|a|tever
it |might be|, c|eas|ed|, holding |the|mselves| rea|dy to |re|sume| their at|tempt|
|without d|elay|.  |But|, a|wk|wardly enough, the |gu|ards| no|w |app|eared|
|at th|e |r|ear of the |temp|le, a|nd the|re| in|st|a|lled |themselves|,
|in| rea|diness |t|o |prevent |a |surpri|se|.|

|It would |be| d|ifficult t|o |d|esc|ribe| t|he |d|isappointment| of the party|,
t|h|us |in|te|rrupt|ed i|n the|ir w|ork.  |Th|e|y |could no|t now |rea|ch the |vi|ct|im|;
|how, |th|en, |co|uld |they |save h|er|?  |Sir Francis |sh|ook| |his fist|s|,
|Passepartout| w|as |b|eside| himself, |and t|he| g|uide gnashed hi|s |teeth| w|ith r|ag|e.
|The |t|ra|nquil |Fogg| |wa|ited|, |without |be|traying an|y |emotion|.|

"|We have| |nothing |to| |do| but |to go| away," |whis|pe|red |Sir Francis|.

"|Not|hing| but t|o go away,|" |echo|ed the guide|.

|"Stop," said |Fogg|.  |"|I |am on|ly |d|ue a|t |Alla|habad to|morrow| be|fore| |noo|n|."
|
"|But| what c|an you |h|ope t|o |do|?|" asked |Sir Fran|cis|.|  "|In |a few hours|
i|t w|ill be| |dayl|ight, |and|--"

|"|Th|e c|hance| w|hi|ch no|w |seems| lo|st |may prese|nt |itself| at th|e| la|st |momen|t.|"

|Sir Francis| would |have |liked |to |read |P|hileas Fogg|'s| eyes|.
What was th|is c|ool| English|man thinking of|?  W|as |he |pla|nning|
|to m|ake |a |rush| |for |th|e |young |woman| at |th|e v|ery| m|oment|
of the| s|acrifice|, and |bold|ly s|na|tch| h|er| f|rom h|er execut|ioner|s|?

|Th|is would be u|tter| |fo|lly|, and |it w|as |har|d |to admi|t t|hat |Fogg|
w|as |s|uch a |fool.  |Sir Francis |cons|ented|, |however|, |to |re|main|
|to the en|d of th|is| t|erribl|e |dram|a|.  |The |guide| led t|hem |to |the rear
|of |th|e |glade|, w|h|ere the|y were |able| to| |observ|e t|he| s|le|eping groups|.
|
|Meanwhile| Passepartout|, |who had |perc|hed hi|mself| on |the |lo|wer |branches
|of |a| t|ree, w|as re|sol|v|ing |an id|ea| whi|ch| had a|t first| st|ruck |hi|m |li|ke| a| flash|,
|and |w|hi|ch |was no|w |f|irml|y lo|dge|d |in |his |brain|.|

|He had| |co|mm|en|ced| by |saying t|o him|self|, "|What| folly!|"| and the|n |he| r|ep|eated|,
|"|W|hy not|, after all|?  |It|'s |a cha|nce perhaps the only one|; and |with| |such s|ot|s!|"
|Th|inking th|us|, he slipped, w|ith |the| |s|upp|leness| of |a |serpen|t|,|
|to the |lowe|st b|ra|nches|, |the| e|n|ds of which bent |al|most |to t|he ground|.

|The |hours passed|, |and| t|he |lighte|r |s|ha|de|s no|w |a|nnounced| the|
app|roach of da|y|, though| it| was n|ot |yet| l|ight|.|  |Th|is was the |m|oment|.
|Th|e |slu|mbering |mult|itude |be|came a|n|ima|ted|, the |t|ambou|rines| |so|unde|d|,
|s|ongs| and |cri|es |aro|se|; |the h|our |of the |sacr|ifice| |ha|d come|.|
|The| doors o|f |the |pa|go|da| sw|ung o|pen, and |a b|right light |es|caped|
from |its interior|, |in |th|e |midst of |which |Mr. |Fogg| |a|nd |Sir Francis|
e|sp|ied |the |vi|ct|im.  |She seemed|, h|a|ving sh|aken off| t|he |stupor| o|f intoxicat|ion|,
|t|o be s|tri|ving to |escape from |her e|xecutioner|.  |Sir Francis|'s h|ear|t| t|hrob|bed;
and|, |c|on|vul|sive|ly |seiz|ing Mr. Fo|gg|'s| ha|nd|, found |in| it |a|n o|pe|n kn|ife|.|
|Just at th|is moment| th|e| c|rowd| began to |move|.  |Th|e young woman| |had |a|gain
|fallen |into |a |stu|por c|aused |by the fu|mes| of |hemp|, |and |pass|e|d a|mong
the| f|a|kirs, who| |es|corted |her| with |th|eir |wild|, re|ligious| c|ries|.
|
Phileas Fogg| and |his |companion|s|, |mingl|ing in the |re|ar |ranks| |of the| |crowd|,
|fo|llowed; |and i|n two minutes| th|ey |reached |the| ba|nks| of the| |st|ream|,
|and |st|opped |fi|ft|y |pac|es |from the |pyre|, u|pon |w|hich| |st|ill| l|ay |the| r|ajah|'s |corpse|.
|In th|e s|e|mi|-obscur|i|ty |the|y s|aw the vi|ctim|, |quit|e s|e|nseless,| s|tretched| o|ut
b|e|side| he|r |husba|nd|'s b|ody|. The|n |a |t|orch| w|as b|rought|, and |the |wood,
|hea|vily |s|oaked with| oil|, |in|s|tant|ly t|ook| f|ire|.

A|t thi|s |moment| |Sir Francis and the guide| s|eized |Phileas Fogg|, |wh|o,
i|n| a|n i|n|stant o|f |mad g|en|ero|sity|, |was |about |to r|ush |upon| the p|yre|.
|But |he |had quickly |pu|sh|ed them |asi|de|, when |the |whole| s|cene |suddenly| c|hanged|.
|A| |c|ry of t|e|rr|or| a|r|ose|.|  |The| |w|hole| |multi|tude| pros|trated |themselves|,
|terror|-s|tricke|n, o|n the |gr|ound|.|

|The |ol|d rajah| was |no|t |dead, t|he|n, si|nce he |ros|e o|f a |sudden|,|
|l|ike a |s|pectre|, t|ook up his |wife| in |his |arm|s, |and |descend|ed |from|
the |pyre| |in the| m|idst of th|e |clouds| of| s|moke|, |which |only
h|e|ightene|d hi|s gh|ostl|y app|ear|ance.|

|F|aki|rs |a|nd s|ol|diers |and |pr|iests|, |seized |with |in|stant| |t|er|ro|r,
|lay th|e|re|, with |th|eir |f|aces| o|n |the| gr|ound|, |no|t |d|aring to |li|ft
the|ir |eyes| and beh|old |s|uch a prod|ig|y|.

|Th|e i|n|animat|e |victim was |b|or|ne |al|on|g |b|y the |vi|go|rous |arms w|hich|
s|u|pp|orted h|er|, |and |wh|ich |she |did not |seem| |in| the| least| |t|o burden|.|
|Mr. Fogg |and |Sir Francis| |s|to|od erect|, |the| Pars|ee| bowed |h|is h|ead|,
|and |Passepartout| |wa|s, no| |doubt|, scar|cely l|ess s|tu|pefied|.

|Th|e r|e|suscitat|ed r|a|jah| ap|proached| |Si|r Francis| and |Mr. Fogg|,
|and|, |in a|n abrupt tone|, |said|, "|Let u|s| be o|ff|!"

|I|t was |Passepartout| himself|, |w|ho| had |slippe|d up|on |the |p|yre|
|in t|he mi|dst of |th|e |s|moke| a|nd|, p|ro|fiting |by th|e s|till
o|ver|hanging |da|rk|ness|, had |de|live|red |th|e young| woman| |from d|eath|!
I|t w|as |Passepartout| |wh|o|, |playing |his |p|art w|ith |a |ha|ppy| au|daci|ty|,
|had passed through |the |c|rowd| a|mid the |g|eneral| ter|ror|.

|A moment a|fter a|ll| four o|f |the |pa|rty |had d|isappear|ed in| t|he| wood|s|,
and| th|e |e|lephant| |was |bearing |the|m| a|wa|y |a|t a r|apid |p|ace|. |But the| c|ri|es|
|and |n|o|ise|, |and| |a b|all |which whi|zzed through |Phileas Fogg|'s| hat,
appr|ised |them |that |the| t|r|ick h|ad |been |dis|cove|red|.

|The| |old| rajah|'s |b|ody|, |indeed, now a|ppeared| u|pon the b|urning |pyre;
|and the| pr|iests|, |rec|overed from |the|ir |te|rror, p|erceiv|ed |th|at| a|n ab|duction
|had taken p|la|ce.  |The|y |ha|sten|ed| into |the |for|est|, |f|ollowed| |by| the| |soldiers|,
|who| fir|ed |a| vo|lley |after the f|ugit|ives|; |but |the| |l|at|ter| ra|pid|ly i|ncreased|
th|e |d|istance| between t|he|m, a|nd e|re |long |fo|und |the|mselves| b|eyond the| r|each

|Th|e |ra|sh expl|oit| |had been |a|cc|omplished|; and| |for| a|n |ho|ur|
P|assepartout| l|aughed g|ai|ly |at his |s|uccess|.  |Sir| F|rancis| p|ress|ed|
|the |wor|thy fellow|'s hand|, and| h|is m|aster| sai|d, "|Well| done|!" which|,
|from |him|, |w|as |h|i|gh| commend|ation|; to which |Passepartout| rep|lied|
th|at |all the |c|redit| of |t|he |affair| |belonged| |to |Mr. Fogg|.  As |for hi|m,
h|e had only be|en |st|ruck |w|ith |a |"quee|r|" |idea; a|nd he laughed|
t|o |t|hink| th|at| for| a| |few moments| he|, Passepartout|, |th|e |ex-g|ymnast,
e|x-sergeant| fireman|, |had been |the |spou|se| of |a |c|harming w|oman|,|
|a| ve|nera|ble, embalme|d |rajah|!  As for |th|e |young |Indian| |woman|,|
|she had |been |uncon|scious |t|hroughout| of what |was p|assing|, a|nd| no|w|,
wr|apped up in| a |tra|vell|ing|-b|lanket, |was |re|p|os|ing in |one| o|f the| |ho|wdahs|.

The| e|lephant|, t|ha|nks to| th|e |skilful |gu|idance| of |the |P|arsee|,|

|br|an|dy a|nd |wa|t|er, |but| the| |dr|owsiness |which |stu|pefied| h|er |could |not|

of th|e |in|toxication| p|roduced |by the |fu|mes| of |hemp|, |reassured| |hi|s
companion|s |on |h|er |a|ccount|.  |But he |was |more dist|urb|ed| |a|t |th|e|

s|hould |A|ouda| re|main |i|n| I|ndia, |she| would inev|ita|bl|y |fall a|gain|

|P|hileas Fogg| |re|plied th|at h|e w|ould |re|f|lect| upon |the| m|atter|.

|Th|e |st|ation| |at |Alla|habad| was |re|ached| a|bout t|en o'clock|, and|,

|The |young woman| was |p|la|ced in |o|n|e of the| wa|iti|ng-room|s of |the station|,

|Passepartout| |made |it |a| p|oint|, |as |he |made hi|s p|ur|chase|s, |to take|

|The |infl|uen|ce| t|o |which |t|he p|riests |of |Pillaji had subject|ed |Aouda|

|Wh|en |the |poet|-kin|g, |Ucaf |Udda|ul, c|el|eb|rates the char|ms|

|that |she w|as a| cha|rming |woman, |in |a|ll th|e |European |acceptation of |the| |ph|ras|e|.

|i|n |saying| t|hat |th|e| |yo|ung |Parsee |had |been |t|ra|nsformed| by |her b|ring|ing |up|.
|
|Th|e| |train| |was |about t|o |star|t| from |Allahabad|, a|nd |Mr. Fogg|
pr|o|ceed|ed |to |p|ay| the g|uide| the pr|ice agreed| upon| for hi|s |s|erv|ice|,

|w|ho| re|m|embered |all |th|at| |his |master| |owed to |th|e g|uide|'s d|evot|ion.|
|He had, |indeed, r|isked| hi|s |life| i|n |the a|dventure| at |Pilla|ji|, and|,
|if he |should |be| |caught after|ward|s| by the |Indian|s, |he would |with|

|Wh|at |sh|ould be done with |th|e e|lephant|, |wh|ich |had been |s|o |dearly p|urchase|d|?
|Phi|leas Fogg| |had |already |d|e|termined| t|his |que|stion|.

|"|Parse|e," said |he| to |the guide|, "you |have |been| se|rv|iceable| a|n|d de|vote|d.
|I have p|a|id |for you|r |service|, |but |no|t |for| you|r |de|votion.|  |W|ould you |l|ike|
to |have |th|is |e|lephant|?  He is your|s.|"
|
|The |guide|'s |eye|s| gli|st|ened|.

"|You|r honour |is |gi|ving| m|e a |for|tun|e|!"| |cried |he|.|

"|Take him, g|uide|," re|turned |Mr. Fogg|, |"and |I |shall| |st|ill |be |you|r |deb|t|or."

|"|Good|!" |exclaimed| |Passepartout|.  "|Ta|ke h|im,| |fri|end|.  |Kiouni| i|s |a brave|
a|nd faithful |be|ast|." | A|nd|, going |up| |to |the| elephant|, he gave him| se|veral|
lumps of |sugar|, sa|ying|, "Here, Kiouni, here|, here|."

|The e|lephant g|runted o|ut his |s|at|isfaction|, |and|, |cl|asping |Passepartout|
|arou|nd the w|aist| |with| |his |t|runk,| lifted hi|m as |high| as |h|is |head|.|
Passepartout|, |not |in |the least |alarmed, c|ar|ess|ed the| an|imal|,
|which |replaced| |him gently on the| ground|.

|S|oon| after, |P|hileas Fogg|, |Sir Francis| Cromarty|, |a|nd |Passepartout|,
|in|stall|ed| i|n a| c|arr|iage| with |A|ouda|, |w|ho| had the |best |s|e|at|,|

Mr. Fogg s|a|id| not|hing|; whi|le Passepartout|, |abas|hed|, |kept repeating| t|hat|
|"it wasn't |wor|th t|elling."

|Aouda| |pathetic|ally| tha|nk|ed |her| del|ivere|rs, |r|ather |with |t|ears
t|han |words|; h|e|r fine eyes| in|ter|pr|eted h|er| gr|atitude| b|etter|
|t|ha|n |her l|i|ps|.  The|n|, |a|s |he|r |thought|s |str|ayed b|ack| t|o the |sc|en|e
of th|e |sacrifice|, |and |rec|all|ed |the |d|a|ngers| w|hich |still| me|nac|ed her|,
she sh|u|ddered |w|ith |terror.

|Phileas Fogg |un|der|stood |w|hat |was |p|assing| in |Aouda|'s |mind|, and| o|ffered|,
in o|rder| t|o r|eassure| her|, |to escort h|er| t|o Hong Kong|, wh|ere| she |might| remain
s|afely |un|til| th|e affair |was |hushed |up|--a|n of|fer| w|hich| |she |e|agerly
|an|d |gr|ateful|ly |a|cc|epted|.  |She had|, i|t s|eem|s, |a| Parsee| re|l|ati|on,

|A|t half-past t|welve| the tra|in |stopped| at |B|enares|.|  |The| |Brah|min l|eg|ends

|Be|nar|es| w|as |Sir Francis| |Cromarty|'s |des|ti|nation|, |the |tr|oops| he
was |rejoin|ing b|eing |e|ncamped some |miles no|rthward| o|f the| |c|it|y.
|He |ba|d|e a|d|ieu| t|o |Phileas Fogg|, |w|ishing |hi|m |all s|uccess|,|
|and |expr|ess|i|ng the| hope |that h|e |w|ould |come| th|at| |way |again|
in| a l|ess or|i|gi|nal b|u|t |m|ore |pro|fita|ble |fashion|.  |Mr.| Fogg |lightly
|pressed him b|y |the hand|.  The| |part|ing of |Aouda|, wh|o |did not f|o|rge|t

|P|assepartout|, h|e |received a| h|eart|y sha|ke o|f| the |h|and from the|

|Th|e |railway|, on leaving |Benares, |pass|e|d |f|or |a w|h|ile a|l|ong t|he|
v|alley of |the |Gang|es|.  |Through the |wind|ow|s |of th|e|ir |car|riage|
|the tra|vellers| had glimpses| of |th|e d|iver|sified |la|ndscap|e of |Behar|,
|with| its |mountain|s| c|lothed |in v|er|dur|e, |i|t|s |fields| of bar|ley|,

|E|lephants were |ba|thing |in the w|aters| of |the |s|acr|ed| |river|,

|Wha|t| would |thes|e divi|n|ities think o|f |India|, a|ngl|ici|sed as it |is |t|o|-day|,

IN WHICH |THE |BAG |OF |BANKN|OTE|S |D|ISG|OR|G|ES|
|S|OME| TH|OU|SA|NDS |OF |P|OUNDS| MORE|


|Th|e |train |entered |the |st|ation|, |and |Passepartout| |jump|ing out| |first|,
|w|as |f|o|llowed| |by |Mr. Fogg|, |who| |ass|isted |hi|s f|air c|ompanion| to |d|esce|nd.|
|Phileas Fogg| |in|tended |to |pr|oceed |at once| |t|o |the |Hon|g Kong| steamer|,|
i|n ord|er to |get |Aouda| |com|forta|bl|y |settl|ed for| |the| |voyage|.
|H|e |was u|nwi|lling to l|eave |her |w|h|il|e| th|e|y |were| still| |on |da|nger|ous| ground|.
|
|Just as he |was| |l|ea|ving th|e |station| a |p|oli|ce|man| came| up| |to him|, and| |said|,
"|Mr. |Phileas Fogg|?"

"|I| am| he."

|"I|s |th|is man| your serv|ant|?"| added the| p|ol|ice|man|, p|oi|nt|ing to| Passepartout|.
|
|"|Yes|."

|"|Be s|o |go|od, |bo|th of you|,| a|s |to |fo|llow |m|e."

|Mr. Fogg| bet|rayed| no |surprise| |what|ever|.  |The| policem|an |was |a|
r|e|presentati|ve |o|f the law|, and |l|aw |is |sacred to a|n |English|man|.|
|P|assepartout |tri|ed to re|ason a|bout the |m|atter|, |but |th|e |p|oli|ceman|
tapped him| with| his |stick|, and |Mr. Fogg| m|ade |h|im| a |signal| to |obey.

"|M|ay| t|hi|s |young lady go with |u|s|?" asked |he|.
|
"|She |ma|y," replied |the |po|liceman|.
|
|Mr. Fogg|, Aouda|, a|nd |Passepartout| |w|ere |con|ducted t|o |a |pal|kiga|hri,
|a| so|rt of fo|ur-|wh|eeled carriage|, draw|n |by |t|wo h|or|se|s, i|n |which| the|y|
took |their p|lace|s and |w|ere |dr|ive|n |a|way|.  |No one spoke| during|
the |tw|enty| mi|nutes |whi|ch |ela|psed |before they reached |t|he|ir |destination|.
|The|y |f|irst| |passed| |th|rough the| |"bl|ack to|wn," w|ith |it|s |narr|ow| s|t|re|et|s|,
|it|s |miserable|, d|irty |huts, |and |s|qual|i|d |p|opulat|ion|; |the|n t|h|rough| the|
|"Europ|ean to|wn|," |which presen|ted |a r|el|ief| i|n it|s |bright| b|rick| |m|ansions|,
|s|haded by |co|conut-tree|s a|nd br|ist|l|ing |w|ith |mast|s, |wh|ere,| a|lthough| it| was
e|arly m|o|rning|, |ele|gantly d|ress|ed| horse|me|n |and ha|ndsome |equi|pages
|were p|assing back |and |fo|rth|.

Th|e |c|arriage stopped before |a m|odest|-l|ooking| h|o|use|, |w|hich|,
|how|ever|, |di|d not |have the |appearance| of a |pri|va|te| ma|nsion|.
|The| p|olice|man ha|ving |requested| his p|rison|er|s |for s|o, t|ru|ly,|
th|ey |might |be |c|alled|-to |d|escend|, c|on|ducted |t|hem |in|to |a |r|oo|m|
|with| b|arre|d windows|, and s|aid|: | "|You |will a|ppear| be|fore|
|Judge Obadiah| at |half-past| e|ight|."

|He th|en re|tired|, |and |cl|osed |the |do|or|.|

|"|Wh|y|, w|e| are |prisoner|s|!" |exclaimed Passepartout|, |falling i|nto a c|ha|ir|.

|Aouda|, |with |an| e|motion| s|he |tri|ed to |conceal, said| t|o |Mr. Fogg|:
|"Sir, |you must leave me |to my |f|ate|!  |It |is |on my a|cc|ount| th|at|
|you |re|ceive |this |tr|ea|tm|ent|, |it is |for h|a|ving |saved m|e|!"

|Phileas Fogg| |cont|e|nted himself with |say|ing t|hat |it w|as| |impossible|.
|It was |quite unl|ik|ely |that |he |sh|ould |be |arrested| for |pr|eventing a |suttee.
|The com|pla|in|an|ts |would not d|are |pre|sent |themsel|ves| with |su|ch a charge|.
|The|re| was |some mistake|.|  |Moreover, |h|e would |not|, |in an|y event,|
a|bandon| Aouda|, |but| |would esc|ort |he|r t|o |Hong Kong|.
|
|"|But th|e s|teamer| l|eaves |a|t |noon|!" obs|erved |Passepartout|, |nervously|.

|"|W|e |sha|ll b|e on board| |by |no|on,|" |re|plied |hi|s |master|, |pl|aci|dly|.

|It was |said so |positi|vely| that P|assepartout| c|ou|ld| not |he|lp|
|m|utter|ing| to |hi|mself|, "|Parbl|eu t|hat|'s |certai|n|!  |Before |noon|
we shall |be| on board|."|  |But| he was| |b|y no |means r|ea|ssured.|

|At |half-past e|ight| the |door| open|ed, the| pol|iceman| app|eared, |and|,
re|qu|e|sting the|m to f|ollow h|im, |led |th|e |wa|y| to a|n adjoin|ing| h|all|.
|It was| evident|ly |a |co|urt-|room|, |and |a c|rowd of European|s and n|atives|
already |occu|pied |th|e |r|ear |of the |a|partment|.

|Mr. Fogg| a|nd hi|s |two co|mpan|ion|s t|ook |the|ir place|s |on |a
b|en|ch |opposite |the |desk|s of the |ma|g|istrate and h|i|s |cl|erk.|
|Imm|edi|ately |after|, |Judge Obadiah|, a| fa|t, |round m|an, fo|llowed by|
|the |clerk, enter|ed|.|  |He| pr|o|ceeded| to |take| do|wn| |a| wi|g w|hich w|as|
h|ang|ing o|n a| |na|il|, and |put |it| |hurr|iedly| on hi|s |h|ead.|

"|Th|e f|irst |ca|se," |said |he|.  |The|n|, |putting |his |hand t|o h|is|
|h|ead|, he exclaim|ed, "|Heh|!  |Th|i|s is no|t my |wig|!"

|"No,| |you|r |wor|ship,|" re|turned the c|le|r|k, "|i|t is |min|e.|"

"|My de|ar |Mr. |Oysterp|uff|, |h|ow |can |a| ju|dge| give a |wis|e |se|ntence|
in a| cle|rk's |wig|?"

|The w|i|gs| were |e|xchanged|.

|Passepartout| |was |get|t|ing |nervous|, |fo|r |the |ha|nds on |the |f|ace| of the big |clock
o|ver |the |judge| |seem|ed |to |go ar|ound |with terrible| |ra|pidity|.

|"|Th|e first |ca|se," |rep|eated |Ju|dge| Oba|diah|.

|"Phileas Fogg|?"| dema|nded |Oysterpuff|.|

|"|I |am here," replied |Mr. |Fogg|.
|
|"|Pa|ssepartout|?"

"|Pr|esent|," |re|spon|ded |Passepartout|.

"|Good|,|" said the |judge|.  "|You |have |been |l|ook|ed for|, pr|isoner|s|,
|for |two |days |on the |tra|in|s |f|rom |Bombay|."

|"|But| of| w|ha|t| are we| |accuse|d|?"| asked |Passepartout|, impatient|ly|.

|"|You are a|bout t|o| be |inform|ed|.|"

"I| am |an |English| s|ubject|, |sir," said |Mr. Fogg|, |"and I |ha|ve |th|e |r|ight|--|"

"|Have you been |ill|-treated|?|"

|"|No|t at all|."

|"Very well|; let the compl|ain|an|ts c|ome in."

|A| d|o|or was |sw|ung |open| by o|rder| o|f the |j|udge|, and th|ree| |Indian pr|iests |ent|ered|.
|
"|That|'s |it|," |muttered |Passepartout|; "|the|se are |th|e |rogue|s
|who |were |going| to b|urn ou|r you|ng lady|.|"

|Th|e| p|riests t|ook| the|ir place|s |in |front| of the |judge|, and |th|e |c|lerk
p|ro|ceed|ed to |re|ad| in |a |l|oud v|oice a| |comp|laint| o|f |sacrilege |a|gainst
|Phileas Fogg |a|nd |his |se|rv|ant|, |who| were |acc|used o|f h|av|ing| |violated|
|a pla|ce |held| c|ons|ecrat|ed| by |the |Brahmin r|el|igion|.|

"|You |h|ear |the| |charge|?"| asked the |judge.

|"Y|es|, sir|," re|plied |Mr. Fogg|, |co|nsulting| his |wa|tch|, |"|and |I| a|dmit| |it|."

|"|You admit| it|?"

"|I a|dmit |it|, a|nd I| wi|sh to h|ear| th|ese |pr|iest|s a|dmit|, |in |th|eir| |turn|,
w|hat |the|y were |going| to |do| at| t|he| |pa|goda| o|f |Pillaji|."

|The| priests |loo|ked |at |each other|; |the|y |did| not |s|eem to |understand
|what |was |said|.

|"Y|es|," cri|ed |Passepartout|, w|arm|ly|; "|at th|e pagoda| of Pillaji|,
|where |the|y were on| the point of |burn|ing |the|ir| v|ictim|."

|The judge stared |with |astonish|ment|, a|nd |th|e| |p|riests were| |stupefied|.
|
|"|What |victim?|" |said |Judge |Obadiah|.|  |"|Burn| w|hom|?  I|n |Bombay| i|tself|?|"

"|Bombay|?" cried |Passepartout|.
|
"|Certainly|.|  |We ar|e not| t|alking| of |the pa|goda| o|f Pillaji|, |but of| |the |pa|goda|
of |Malabar Hill|, a|t B|ombay|.|"

"|And |as |a| |pr|oof,|" ad|d|ed th|e |clerk|, "he|re| are| the desec|rat|or|'s very |sho|es|,
wh|ich |he l|eft |be|hind| him|.|"

|Whereupon |he p|la|ced a |p|air o|f s|ho|es| on his |desk|.|

|"|My |s|hoes!" cried |Passepartout|, in |his |surpr|ise| per|mitting|
|th|is imprudent e|xc|lamation| t|o |escape| h|im|.

|The |co|nfusion| of| m|aster |and m|a|n, who| had |quite f|orgotten the|
a|ffair |at |Bombay|, f|or wh|ich the|y |were no|w d|et|ain|ed| at Calcutta|,
|may be imagined.|

|Fix| t|he |de|tective|, |ha|d |f|o|re|seen| th|e| adv|antage w|hich |Passepartout|'s|
|e|s|capade gave hi|m, a|nd|, |del|aying hi|s |departure| f|or| t|w|e|lve| h|our|s|,

|he pr|omis|ed the|m |a g|ood|ly |s|um |in |dam|ages, and| s|ent| the|m fo|rward|
t|o |Calcutta| |by the |next| |t|rain|.  |Ow|ing t|o the d|e|lay| c|aused| by the| r|e|s|cu|e
of the| |young| w|idow|, Fix| a|nd the| |pr|iests| |rea|ched the| |Indian |capital b|e|fore|

w|hen he lea|r|ned |that |Phileas Fogg |had |not |made |his appearance| in C|alcutt|a

|some|wh|er|e on| the ro|ute| a|nd take|n |re|fug|e| in |the s|outhern p|rovinces.
|For| tw|enty|-f|our hours| |Fix |wa|tched| the |st|ation| w|ith |f|everi|sh an|xiety|;
a|t |l|ast he was re|wa|rded by s|e|eing Mr. Fogg| |and |Passepartout| arrive|,

to be |arrest|ed| an|d b|rought| before| |Judge Obadiah|.

|Had Passepartout| b|een |a| l|ittle l|ess |pr|eo|ccupied, h|e |would |have|
|esp|ied the d|etective| en|sconced |in a |cor|ner| o|f |the| |co|urt-room|,|

|for the wa|rrant had |fa|iled |to |re|a|ch |him| at |Calcutta|,
|a|s |it |had |d|one| at |Bombay| a|nd |Suez|.|

|Judge |Obadiah| had |unfortun|ately caught| Passepartout|'s| r|ash| ex|clamation|,
w|hich |the| p|o|or |fellow |w|ould |have |given| |th|e |world| |to| re|c|all|.
|
"|The fa|ct|s |a|re |admitted?"| asked |the |judge.

"|Admitted,|" repl|ied Mr. Fogg|, co|ldly|.

|"|Inasmuch,|" |re|s|umed |the |judge|, "|as |the English law |protects |equ|al|ly|
a|n|d ster|nly| t|he re|ligion|s of the |Indian| people|, a|nd |as the |m|an|

at B|ombay|, o|n| the |20th| of |October|, |I |con|d|emn| th|e s|ai|d Passepartout|
to im|pr|isonment| for fi|fteen |da|ys a|nd| a |f|i|ne o|f th|ree h|undred| pounds|."

|"Th|re|e hundred pounds|!|" |cr|ied |Passepartout|, |st|ar|tled |at the la|rge|ne|ss
of t|he s|um|.

|"Sil|ence|!" s|houted| the constable|.
|
"|A|nd |inasm|uch," |continued the |j|udge|, "a|s |it is not |prove|d that|
|the |act |was |no|t d|one |by th|e |c|o|nnivan|ce| of t|he m|aster| w|ith |the| |servant|,

|Fix| |rubbed his ha|nd|s softl|y| w|ith satisfaction|; i|f |Phileas Fogg|
|could be| |de|t|a|in|ed| in |Ca|lcutta |a w|eek|, i|t w|ould |be |more |th|an |t|ime|

|r|uined his |master|.  |A |wager |of |twenty| t|housand| pounds| lost|, |beca|use |he|,
like |a |pr|ec|ious fool, h|ad gone |in|to th|at| a|bomina|ble p|ago|da|!

|Phileas F|ogg|, |as |s|el|f-|compose|d |as if |the| judgm|ent| |did not|

he r|ose|, and| |said|, "|I off|er b|ail.|"

"|You |have th|at| right|,|" re|turned the |judge|.

|Fix|'s |blood| r|a|n |cold|, |but |he re|sumed| his c|omp|osure| wh|en |he heard|
th|e |judge |a|nn|ounce| |that the| b|ail re|quir|ed for each pr|isoner|
w|ould be on|e tho|u|sa|nd| pounds|.

|"I| will pay it at |once," said |Mr. Fogg|, |t|aking |a| ro|ll of| |bank|-b|ills|
|from the |ca|rp|et-|bag|, |which |Passepartout |had |by |hi|m, a|nd| |pla|cing| |them
|o|n the |c|lerk's de|sk.

|"|Th|is |s|um| will be |re|stored| to |you| |upon your r|el|ea|se| from pri|son|,"
|said |the |judge|.  "|Meanwhile|, you |are l|ibera|ted on |ba|il.|"

"|C|ome|!"| |said |Phileas Fogg| |to hi|s |servant|.

|"|But |let |th|em at least| g|ive me| b|ack| |my s|h|oes|!|" cried |Passepartout| a|n|gr|i|ly|.

|"A|h, |th|ese are pretty de|ar shoes|!"| he |muttered, as the|y were| h|and|ed| t|o |hi|m.
|"|More| than a |th|ousand pounds| ap|iec|e; besides,| th|e|y pi|nch my |feet|."

|Mr. Fogg|, |offering his arm |to Aouda|, |the|n| depart|ed|, followed|
|by |the| |c|rest|f|allen| Pa|ssepartout|.  |Fix |still| |nou|r|ished| hopes|
|t|hat the| |robber w|ould |no|t|, |after |all|, |le|ave th|e |two |thousand| po|unds|
|behind| him|, |but |would |decide to |serve |out |his week in| jai|l,|
and |issued f|orth |on |Mr. Fogg's |tra|ce|s.  |Th|at |gentleman| t|o|ok| a |carriage|,
|and |th|e |part|y |were |so|on l|and|ed on on|e of the |qu|ay|s.|

|The |Rangoon |was |moored h|alf| a| mile off| in |the harbour|, i|t|s s|ignal|
|of |d|eparture| ho|ist|ed a|t |the |m|ast|-hea|d|.  |Eleven o'clock |wa|s st|ri|king;
Mr. Fogg w|as |a|n hour |in| adv|ance| o|f t|ime.|  |Fix |saw |the|m leave| |th|e c|arriage| and|
|push of|f |in |a |boat| for the steam|er|, |and |s|tamped |hi|s f|eet| with| d|isa|pp|ointment|.

"|T|h|e rascal is o|f|f|, a|fter all|!"| he exclaimed|.  "|T|wo t|housand pounds| s|acrificed|!

|The detectiv|e| was |not |far |wrong i|n making this |con|jecture|.
|Since leaving| London|, |w|h|at w|ith| t|ra|vel|l|ing| |expe|ns|e|s, |bri|be|s,|

|IN WHICH |FI|X| D|OES| NO|T |S|EEM |TO |UN|DER|S|TAN|D|
|IN |TH|E |LEA|ST |W|H|AT |IS |SAI|D T|O |HIM


|The |Rangoon|--o|ne| of| the P|enin|s|ula|r |an|d |O|riental Company|'s |boats
|pl|yi|ng in| |the |Chi|n|ese |an|d |Japanese| s|eas|--was a s|c|rew steamer|,|
|built |of |iron|, |weighing| |about |seve|nte|en |h|undred and |seventy| to|ns,|
|and |with |e|ngin|es |of |fo|ur hundred |horse|-p|ower|.  Sh|e |w|as a|s |fast,|
b|ut no|t as well fit|ted up|, a|s |the |Mo|n|golia|, |and| |Aouda| was |no|t |a|s
c|om|fortabl|y |p|r|ov|ided| for o|n |board| o|f |her |a|s |Phileas Fogg| could |have wished.
|However, t|he |trip from Calcutta to |Hong Kong| only compr|ised |s|ome|
|th|re|e |t|housand f|ive hundred| |miles|, occu|pyi|ng |f|rom |ten |to |twelve| d|ays|,
|and| th|e |young woman| |was |not |d|ifficul|t to |p|lease.|

|D|uring th|e first |days| o|f |the journey| |Aouda |became| better |a|cquainted
with h|er |protector|, |and |co|nstantly |gave| ev|idence| o|f her |d|eep| gr|at|itude|
|for what |he |had done.  The phl|egmat|ic |gen|tleman| li|stene|d to h|er|,
|appar|ently |at |least|, w|ith c|o|ldness|, neither| h|is voice n|or |hi|s ma|nner
b|etraying th|e| sl|ight|e|st |emotion|; but he |seemed |to |be |always o|n the |watch|
t|ha|t |nothing |should |be |w|anting to |Aouda|'s |com|fort|.  H|e |visit|ed her
|regula|r|ly ea|ch d|ay| |at |certain| |ho|ur|s|, no|t |so| much |to |t|alk| |hi|mself|,
a|s |to |s|it |an|d |he|a|r |he|r t|alk|.|  |He| |t|reated h|er with |the |stric|t|est| |po|liteness|,
|but |with |the| pr|e|ci|sion| of |a|n aut|omaton|, the| movements |of |w|hich| had |b|een|
a|rr|anged| for| th|is pur|po|se|.  |Aouda |did |not |qu|ite| know wh|at| to |make| of |him|,
|though| |Passepartout| |had |gi|ven| |her |some h|ints o|f h|is |master|'s e|ccentricit|y|,
and m|ad|e |her| |smile by |telling he|r |o|f |the w|a|ger| w|hich |was| |se|nd|ing him|
round the w|or|ld|.  After |all|, |she ow|ed |P|hileas Fogg| h|er l|ife|,| and she|
|a|lways |re|g|arded h|im| t|hrough the |e|xal|ting me|di|um| of her grat|it|ude|.

|Aoud|a co|n|firmed |th|e| Parsee guide|'s |narrativ|e o|f h|er |tou|ching| history|.
|She d|id, |in|deed, be|long t|o th|e |h|ighe|st of the |na|tive |races| of |India|.
Many o|f th|e |Parsee |merchant|s |ha|ve ma|de |g|reat| f|ortune|s there| b|y |de|ali|ng|
in cotton; and| on|e o|f the|m, |Si|r |Jame|tse|e |Jeeje|ebhoy, was m|ade| |a b|ar|onet|

and |i|t |was h|is c|ou|sin|, |Jeejee|h|, w|hom she |hoped t|o |join |at Hong Kong|.
|Whether |she |would |find |a |pro|tector| in |hi|m |s|he could not |tell|;
|but Mr. Fogg| es|sa|yed to calm h|e|r |a|nxietie|s, and |to |as|sure |he|r that|
|every|thing| wo|uld be| |m|athe|matically|--|he us|ed th|e very word--arr|anged|.
|Aouda| |fas|tened her| |gr|eat eye|s|, |"|clear a|s the|e| sa|cr|ed la|kes of the| |Himal|aya,|"
u|pon h|im; |but |the| in|tr|actable Fogg|, as |re|s|erved| as |e|ver|,| did not |seem|
|at all i|n|clin|ed to |throw| hi|mself| |into |th|is |la|ke|.|

|The| first |f|e|w |da|ys o|f the| voyage| |passed pros|perous|ly|, amid |favoura|ble|
w|eather| a|nd |p|ro|piti|ous w|ind|s, |and |the|y |s|o|on| c|ame in |sight| of|

a|pproach|ed| |the| |Stra|it|s of |Mal|acca|, which |gave| a|cc|e|ss t|o t|h|e |China| seas.|
|
|What |was de|tective| |Fi|x, s|o unl|uckily drawn on f|rom cou|nt|ry| to c|ountry|,|
|d|o|ing |a|ll th|is |while|?  |He |had| ma|naged t|o |e|mbark| o|n |the |Rangoon| at |Calcutta|
|with|out b|eing se|en| by |P|assepartout|, a|fter leaving o|rders| that|,|
i|f the| |w|arrant should |arriv|e|, |i|t |s|hould |be |for|ward|ed| |to |hi|m| |at| Hong Kong|;
|and| he hoped| to |co|nceal| hi|s |pre|sence |t|o |th|e |end of the |voyage|.
|It w|ould have |been |difficult to |ex|plai|n| w|h|y| |he was |on |board|
w|ithout a|wak|ening| |Passepartout|'s |suspicions|, who| thought |him s|till| at |Bombay|.|

|the last Engli|sh ground| o|n |which |he would |set f|oot|; |beyond|, C|hina,|
|Japan, |A|merica| of|fered to |Fog|g |a|n a|lmost c|ertain| re|fuge|.
|I|f |the |warrant |shou|ld a|t l|ast |m|ake |it|s a|ppearance| at |Hong Kong|,
|Fix| co|uld |ar|rest |him |and g|ive| |him |in|to |the |ha|nd|s of |the |loc|al |po|l|ice|,
|and |the|re w|ould be n|o f|ur|ther t|r|oubl|e.  |But b|e|yond| Hong Kong|,
|a| si|mple wa|rra|nt |would be |of n|o| av|ail|; an| extradi|tion| wa|rrant|
|w|ould be |n|ecessary|, a|nd |that| |would |re|sult| in |de|lays| an|d |ob|s|tacles|,
of which |the |rascal| wou|ld take| advantage| to |el|ude |justi|ce|.|
|
|Fix| |thought| o|ver| |the|se |pr|obabilit|ies |during the |l|ong| ho|urs|
|whi|ch h|e s|pe|nt in hi|s |cabin|, |and kept repeat|ing t|o| |him|self|,|
|"|Now|, ei|ther t|he| w|arra|nt w|ill be| at |Hong Kong|, in |which| |ca|se
|I s|hall |arrest| my ma|n,| or i|t |will |not |be |there; and th|is time|
it is a|bsolutely necessary| t|hat |I |should del|ay| h|is dep|arture|.
|I ha|ve |fa|iled |at |Bombay|, and |I |have |failed |at |Calcutta|; |i|f I |fail|
|a|t |Hon|g |Kong|, |my re|putation| is |lost|:  Cost| what it may|, I mu|st |su|cceed|!
|But how sha|ll| I prev|ent |his |departure|, |if |that should t|ur|n o|ut to be
|my |last re|source|?"

|Fix |made up |his |mind |th|at|, if |worst| c|ame t|o |w|or|st|, |he w|ould |ma|ke|
|a co|nf|idant of |Pa|ssepartout|, a|nd |tell him w|hat| kind of |a f|ellow
|hi|s |master| re|ally| |w|as|.  |Th|at |Passepartout| w|as no|t |Fo|gg|'s |acco|mplice|,
h|e was |very |certain|.  |The| |servant|, enl|i|gh|tened |by |his dis|closur|e,
|and |afrai|d of be|ing |him|self| |impl|icated i|n the |cr|ime|, w|ould |d|oubtles|s|
|become |an| |ally| of t|he detective|.|  |But |th|is |met|hod was a| da|ngerous| on|e,
|on|ly |to be |em|ployed| when e|very|thing| else| had |failed|.  |A w|ord f|rom|
|Pa|ssepartout| to |his |master| |would |ruin| all|.|  |The| d|etective| was |the|re|fore
in a |sor|e| |str|a|it|.  B|ut |suddenly| |a new idea s|truck him|.|  |The| |pre|sence|
o|f |Aouda o|n the |Rangoon|, in co|mpany| w|ith| |Phileas| Fogg|, gave| him|
|ne|w |ma|terial for re|fl|ect|ion|.|

|Who |was |this woman|?|  W|hat| combinat|ion| of |e|ve|nt|s| ha|d made| |her| |Fogg's
t|ra|velling comp|anion|?  |The|y ha|d evidently| met |some|where be|tween |Bo|mbay
and |Ca|lcutta|; |b|ut| whe|re|?  |Had |the|y met |a|cc|ident|al|ly|, o|r |had Fogg| g|one
in|to the |i|nterior| p|urpos|e|ly| i|n qu|est of th|is c|ha|rming |dam|sel|?
|Fix was f|ai|r|ly puzzled.  |He |asked himself w|hether| the|re| had |not|
been |a| |wicked |el|opement|; |and this |idea so impressed| i|ts|elf
|upon his mind| that| |he |d|ete|rmi|ned| to make u|se of| t|he| suppose|d i|n|t|rigue|.|
|Wh|ether |the young woman| |w|ere |ma|rrie|d o|r |no|t|, he |would |be |a|ble| to |cre|ate|
|s|uch difficult|ies |f|or |Mr. Fogg| a|t |Hong Kong| t|h|at |he |could not |escape|
|by |paying| any am|ount |of m|oney|.

|But| |cou|ld he even |w|ait |t|ill the|y re|ached| |Hon|g Kong|?  |Fogg| had a|n
|abo|minabl|e w|ay |o|f j|um|ping |from on|e |boat| to |another|, and|, |b|e|fore a|ny|thing|
|c|ould |be ef|fected|, might |get f|ull |und|er way |again| for |Yokohama|.
|
|Fix |d|eci|ded t|hat |he |must| |warn| |the| |English| a|uthorit|ies|, |and |s|ignal|
the |R|angoon be|fore h|er |ar|rival.  |This |was e|asy |to |do, |si|nce| the| |st|eam|er|
|stop|ped |at |Singapore|, whe|nce |the|re is |a t|ele|graphic wire| to| |Hong Kong|.
|He |finally| re|solved|, m|o|reover, b|efore a|ct|ing |more| p|ositi|ve|ly|,
to |qu|est|ion| Passepartout|.  |It w|ould not be |di|fficult t|o make| him| talk|;
a|nd, as th|e|re| w|as |no |time to l|ose|, |Fix p|repar|ed t|o |make| |hi|mself| known|.
|
|It was now th|e |3|0th of |October, |and |on the |fo|llowing da|y t|h|e| |Rangoon
w|as |due| a|t |Si|ngapore|.

Fix |e|merged |from |his ca|bin| a|nd |we|nt on deck|.  |Passepartout| was|
pr|om|enading up and |down| in| |th|e |for|ward part |of the |ste|amer|.
|The| |detective| rushed |forward with |eve|ry appearance o|f |extreme|
s|urprise|, |a|nd |excl|aim|ed, "|Y|ou |here|, o|n| the |Rangoon|?"

|"|What|, |Mons|ieur Fix|, are you| |on board|?" re|turned |the r|e|al|ly
astonish|ed |Passepartout|, |re|c|ognising his |c|rony of the |Mongolia|.
|"|Why|, I| l|eft you| a|t Bombay|, and |he|re| you |a|re|, on |the wa|y to| Hong Kong|!
|Ar|e you going ro|und the world |too|?"

"|No|, |no|," |replied |Fix|; "I |shall st|op a|t |Hong Kong|--|at le|ast| fo|r some| |d|ays|."

|"|Hum|!" |said |Passepartout|, |w|ho| |seemed |for |a|n |instant| pe|rplex|ed.
"|But how is it |I ha|ve n|ot s|een you| on board| si|n|ce we left |Calcutta|?"

"|Oh|, |a |t|rifle of |s|ea-sickness--I|'ve |b|een s|t|aying| in my berth.|
The |Gulf of| |B|e|ngal| does |not |a|gree| with |me |a|s well |as |the |I|ndian Ocean|.
And how |is |Mr. Fogg|?"

"|As w|ell| a|nd a|s pun|ctual| as |ever|, no|t |a |d|ay be|hind| time|!
|But|, |M|onsieur Fix|, |you do|n|'t |know| |that| we |have |a you|ng lady| |with us|."

"A| young la|dy|?"| replied| the |detective|, |not s|eeming| t|o |comp|rehend
what |w|a|s |s|aid|.

|Passepartout |there|up|on| rec|o|unted |Aouda|'s h|i|story, t|he a|ffa|ir|
a|t t|he |B|ombay| p|agoda|, |th|e |purchase| of the e|lephant| f|or|
|t|wo |thousand |pounds|, |the| r|escue|, |the| ar|rest|, |a|nd s|ent|ence
of the |Calcutta court|, |and the |restora|tion| of Mr. Fogg|
and |himself| |to |liberty |on |b|ail|.  F|ix, |who| |was f|amiliar|
with the |last |eve|nts|, s|eemed to |be e|qu|ally |ignorant |of a|ll|
th|at| |Passepartout| |relat|ed; and |th|e l|ater |was| |ch|ar|med|
to |find |so in|te|rested| |a l|i|ste|ne|r.

|"But| does you|r master| p|ropos|e to c|arry |th|is| yo|ung |woman| to |Europe|?"

"|No|t at |all|.  We are si|mpl|y going to| p|la|ce| her| und|er| t|h|e pr|o|tect|ion
of |one of |her |relati|ves|, |a| r|i|ch |merchant a|t |Hon|g Kong|.|"

|"|No|thing| to |be |done| |t|here,|" |said |Fix| |to him|self|, co|nceal|ing |hi|s disapp|ointment|.
|"A |glas|s of |g|in, |Mr. |Passepartout|?"

|"|Willi|ngly|, Monsieur| F|ix|.  |We |must a|t lea|st h|ave |a f|rie|nd|ly gla|ss

|

|The d|etective| and Passepartout| met o|fte|n |on |deck| a|fter |th|i|s int|erview|,
|t|hough| |Fix| w|as |reserved|, |and| d|id not |attempt to |in|duce hi|s |companion|
to |d|ivulge |any| more fa|cts con|cerning| Mr. Fogg|.  H|e cau|ght |a glimpse
of that |m|yst|erious gentleman on|ce |or |t|wi|c|e; but |Mr. Fogg |us|ually c|o|nfin|ed
|hi|mself |to| t|he |cabin|, |whe|re |he |kept |Aouda |co|mp|an|y|, |or|, a|ccording to |his|
|inveterat|e h|abit, |took |a ha|nd |at w|hist|.

|Passepartout| began |very se|riously| |to co|n|jecture| w|hat str|ange|
cha|nce k|ept Fix| st|ill on the r|o|ute| t|hat| his master| w|as p|u|rsu|ing.
|It was |really wor|th |co|ns|ider|ing why| th|is |c|ertain|ly very |am|iable|
|an|d |c|o|mpla|cent| person|, |wh|om he had |first| m|et at |Suez|, |had t|hen|
encount|ered on board| the |Mongolia|, w|ho| d|i|sembarked| |at |Bombay|,
w|hich |he a|nnounced a|s |his |d|es|tination|, |and| |now| turn|ed |up| s|o
|une|xpect|edly on |the |Rangoon|, |w|as |f|o|llow|ing |Mr. |Fogg|'s| |tra|cks| st|ep
b|y |s|t|ep|.|  |What w|as Fix's o|bject|?  |Passepartout| w|as r|eady| to |wager| h|i|s
I|ndian |s|h|oes|--w|h|ich he re|ligi|ously pre|served--|t|hat |Fix would| a|lso| |l|eave|
|Hon|g Kong| at the |same time |w|ith the|m,| |and |p|robably |o|n |the |s|ame |steamer|.

|Passepartout| might have |cudge|lle|d| h|is |br|ain |for| a c|e|ntury w|ithout
|hi|tt|ing u|pon the |real| o|bject w|hich |the |detective| had in |vi|ew|.
H|e never |co|uld |ha|ve |imagined| |that |Phileas Fogg| |was |be|ing |tra|ck|ed
|as |a robber| around the g|lobe|.  |But|, a|s |it |is in |h|u|man| n|ature |to attempt|
t|h|e| sol|u|tion| of eve|ry my|ster|y, P|assepartout| suddenly |di|scovered|
|a|n exp|lanation of |Fix|'s m|ovement|s|, |which| was| in |t|ruth |f|ar from |unre|a|sona|ble|.|
|Fix, h|e |thought|, |could |on|ly| be an| a|g|ent| of |Mr. Fogg|'s |friends|
|at the |Reform Club|, |s|ent |to |follow| h|im| u|p, and |to as|certain|
that he |real|ly |w|e|nt round the |world| |as |h|ad been| a|greed| upon|.

|"|It|'s |clear|!" |re|peated |th|e |wo|r|thy s|ervant| |to h|im|self|, proud |of |his |sh|rewd|ness.
|"He|'s a spy sent |t|o |keep us in| v|iew|!  |Th|at |is|n't |qui|te| t|he |t|hi|ng|, e|i|ther|,
t|o |be sp|yi|ng |Mr. Fogg, |wh|o |is s|o h|onourable |a| ma|n!  |Ah|, |gentlemen| o|f| the |Reform|,
this s|h|all |co|st you |dea|r|!"

|Passepartout|, |en|ch|anted |with |his |disco|very|, res|olved |to |say
nothing| to |hi|s |master|, l|est |he should |be justl|y o|ffen|ded |at |th|is|
m|ist|ru|st| on |the |part of |hi|s a|dversari|es.|  |But |he |d|etermined|
|to |c|haf|f Fix, wh|e|n he had| |the c|h|an|ce|, |with| mysterious a|ll|u|sions|,
|which|, |h|owever|, |need |not betray| |his re|al s|u|spicio|n|s|.

|During th|e |afternoon of W|ednesday,| |30th| October, |th|e |Rangoon
entered the |Strait| of |Mal|acca|, |which |s|epar|ates th|e p|e|ninsula|
o|f |th|at |na|me| |from |Suma|tra|.  |The |mountain|ous a|nd |craggy| isl|ets|
in|terce|pted| th|e b|eaut|ies of |th|is noble| |island| from t|he vi|ew|
o|f the |travellers|.  |The| |Rangoon |weig|hed a|ncho|r| at |Si|ngapore| the next |day|
a|t |four| a|.m|.|, t|o re|ceive| c|oal, ha|ving |ga|i|ned| ha|lf |a |d|ay| o|n |the pre|scribe|d
t|ime| of| her a|rr|ival|.  |Phileas |Fogg |no|ted th|is gain |in| |his |journal|, |and |th|e|n|,
a|cco|mpanied by |Aouda, |who| |betrayed |a| |de|sir|e f|or |a |wa|lk |on sho|r|e, dis|emba|rked.

Fi|x|, w|ho |sus|pected |Mr. Fogg|'s e|ve|ry| movement|, |fo|llowed them| cautious|l|y,
w|ith|out be|ing |h|im|self |p|erce|ived|; while Passepartout|, l|aughing |in| |his |sl|ee|ve|
a|t |Fix|'s man|oeuvr|es|, |w|ent |about |hi|s |usual erra|nd|s.

|Th|e |i|sland of |Si|ngapore| is no|t |imposing| in| a|spect|, |for| the|re |are|
no| mountain|s; |y|et |its a|pp|earance| is not |without |attractions.
|It |is |a |p|ark checke|red by |p|leasan|t h|ighwa|ys| |a|nd |avenues.|
|A| |handsome |car|ri|age|, |draw|n |by |a |s|le|ek pair of |Ne|w |Holland| h|or|ses,
|carried P|hileas |Fogg a|nd |Aouda| |in|to the |mi|dst| of |ro|ws| o|f |pa|lm|s|
w|ith b|ri|llian|t |f|oliage, and of| |cl|ove-|trees|, |wh|ere|of the| clo|ves|
|fo|r|m the| h|eart |of a| |half|-o|pen f|l|ower|.  |Pepper plant|s |rep|la|ced
|the pr|i|ckl|y h|edges| of |Europ|ean| fields|; s|ago|-b|ush|es|,| large |fe|rns|
with |gorgeo|us| br|an|ches|, |vari|ed th|e as|pect| of |th|is |tro|pical c|l|ime|;
|while |nut|meg-t|ree|s| i|n f|ull foliage f|ill|ed |the air w|ith |a |pe|netr|ating p|er|f|ume.|
A|gile an|d |gr|inn|ing band|s| of monkeys| |s|ki|pped about| i|n |the trees|, n|o|r we|re| |t|ig|ers
want|ing |in the |jun|gles|.|

|After |a d|ri|ve| of |t|wo |hours| |t|hrough the |count|ry|, |Aouda| a|nd |Mr. Fogg|
|returned |to |the |t|own|, |whi|ch |is a| |vast |col|lection| of |h|ea|vy-|looking,
|i|rr|eg|ular |hou|se|s|, surrounded by |char|ming| |ga|rdens| |r|ich |in t|ropi|cal |fr|uit|s
and pl|ants|; |and a|t t|en o'clock| the|y re-emba|rked, c|lo|sely| f|ollowed| by|
the |de|tective|, wh|o |had |kept |them |con|stant|ly| in| s|ig|ht.

|Passepartout|, |wh|o had| been |p|urchasing |s|everal d|oze|n |ma|ng|oes|--
|a| |fr|uit |as |l|arge as |goo|d-s|ized a|ppl|es|, o|f |a d|ark-|br|own c|ol|our|
outsi|de| a|nd |a |br|i|ght| re|d with|in|, and |w|hose w|hite pulp|, melting in|
the m|o|uth, a|ffords |gourmands| a| |del|icious sen|sation|--was w|a|iting|
|for |the|m| on d|eck.|  |He |was on|ly| t|oo g|lad |to o|ffer |some m|an|goes
|to A|ouda|, |wh|o tha|nked h|i|m| |very |gr|acefully| f|or |the|m.|

A|t eleven |o'clock| the |Rangoon |ro|de out |of |Singa|pore| ha|rbour,
and |in |a |few |ho|urs |the h|igh mountain|s| o|f |Mal|acca|, w|ith |t|heir |fore|sts|,
|inha|bite|d |by the |most |bea|utifu|l|ly-f|urred ti|gers| in |the wo|rld|,|
|were lo|st| to |vi|ew.|  |Si|ngapor|e| is dist|ant| so|me| t|hirt|een hundred| miles|
|from the |island of |Hong Kong|, |wh|ich| is |a little| E|nglish co|lony
n|ear |the |Chinese |coa|st|.|  |P|hileas Fogg| |hoped| t|o ac|complish| the| |journey|
|in| s|ix |da|ys|, s|o a|s |to| |b|e |in |time for the |steamer| |w|hich would leav|e
|on |t|he |6th of N|ovember| for| Y|okohama|, the principal| |Japanes|e| |port|.|

T|he| |Ra|ngoon |ha|d |a| large |quota| |of p|assengers|, many of w|hom| d|is|embarked|
|at |Si|ngapore|, |am|ong the|m |a| number| of |Indians|, C|eylon|e|se|,| China|men|,
|Mala|ys, |and |Portugue|se|, |mostly |second-|class t|r|avellers|.

|Th|e |w|eather|, w|h|ich| h|ad hitherto been |fin|e|, c|ha|nged| with| the|
|l|ast |quarter of the |mo|on.  Th|e |s|ea roll|ed |hea|vily|, and |the |wind|
a|t |interval|s rose| |almost |to |a |s|torm|, |but h|app|ily| b|l|ew f|rom|
the s|outh|-west|, and th|us aided the st|eam|er|'s |p|ro|gress.|
|The |captain| a|s o|ften |as possible| p|ut up |his sails,|
|and |under th|e |do|uble| a|c|tion| of |st|eam| and sa|il |the |ve|ssel m|ade|
r|apid p|rogress| al|ong |the c|oast|s of |A|nam and |Coc|hin| China|.|
Owing t|o the de|fective| co|nstr|uctio|n |of |the |Rangoon|, h|owever|,|
|un|usual| pr|ec|aut|ion|s |be|came |ne|cessary| i|n un|f|avourable |wea|ther|;
but| the| lo|ss o|f t|ime| w|h|ich |resulted| from th|is |ca|use|, |while |it|
|nearly d|rove Passepartout| out| of |his |sen|se|s, |did not seem|
|to |affect| h|is master| in |the least|.  |Passepartout| blamed the |ca|ptain|,
|the |engineer|, and |the| c|r|ew|, and |co|ns|igned |all w|ho were |c|on|nected|
with |th|e ship| |t|o |the l|and |where |the| |pepp|er gro|ws.|  |Perhaps the| th|ought
|of |the |gas|, which| was |r|e|mo|rselessly bu|rning| |at h|is |expense| in| Saville Row|,
had |something t|o |d|o| with |his |ho|t i|mpatience.|
|
|"|You are |in |a gr|eat hurry|, |t|hen|," said |Fix| to him| one| d|ay|, |"t|o |re|a|ch |Hong Kong|?"

"|A |very great| hurry!"

|"Mr. |Fogg,| I s|uppos|e|, is anxious |to| |catch th|e s|teamer| for |Yokohama|?"

|"T|erribl|y| a|nx|ious|."

|"|You |be|lieve| in| this |jo|ur|ney |a|round |the world|, |then|?"

"|Ab|solutely|.  |Don't |you|,| Mr. |Fix|?"

|"I|?  I |don't b|el|ieve| a |wo|rd |of| |it.|"

|"You|'re |a |sl|y |dog|!|" said |Passepartout|, w|inking |at hi|m.|
|
|Th|is e|xpression |r|ather dis|turb|ed| |Fix|, |w|ithout |his |knowing| wh|y|.
Had |the |Frenchman |guessed his |real |pur|pose|?  |He| knew not| w|hat|
t|o |think|.  |But |how |could |Passepartout| have |dis|covered| th|at |he|
was |a |detective|?  |Yet, in s|pea|king a|s he |did|, the |m|a|n e|vidently|
|meant |more |than |he |e|xpress|ed.|

|Passepartout| w|ent |still |fu|r|ther |the next |day|; he |c|ould no|t |hold |his| to|ngue|.

|"|Mr. Fix,|" |said |he, |in a| b|an|te|ring |tone|, "shall we |be |s|o |unfo|rtunate|
|as |to |lose |you |w|hen we get t|o| Hong Kong|?"

"|Why|,|" respond|ed |Fix|, a| little| |e|mbar|rassed|, "|I| do|n|'t |kno|w|; |p|erhaps|--"

"|Ah, |if |you| would only go| on |with |us|!  |An |a|ge|nt| of the |P|eninsular Company|,
|you| know|, |can|'t |s|t|op on |the |wa|y!|  |You |we|re |only going| to |Bombay|,
|and |here| you |are |in C|hi|na|.|  |America| is no|t f|ar off, and |from |A|merica
to |Europe| is |on|ly |a| st|e|p.|"

|Fix l|ooked |int|en|tly |at |his companion|, |wh|o|se |co|u|nte|nance| |was|
|a|s |se|rene |a|s p|ossible|, and |l|aughed| |with |hi|m|.  |But Passepartout|
|persiste|d |in |c|haff|ing |hi|m b|y asking |hi|m if |he |m|ade muc|h| |by |his|
p|re|sent| o|ccup|at|ion|.|

|"|Ye|s,| and no,|" re|turned |Fix|; "t|he|re| is good| and b|a|d luck |in| su|ch |th|ing|s|.
|But you must u|n|derstand| that| |I don't |t|ra|vel |a|t m|y |ow|n e|xpen|se."

"|Oh|, |I| am |qu|it|e |sure of th|at|!" |cried |Passepartout|, |laughing |heartily.
|
|Fix|, |f|air|ly |puzzled|, des|cend|ed |t|o hi|s c|abin| and |gave| himself|
u|p |to hi|s re|flection|s.  He |was e|vidently |suspected|; |s|omehow|
or o|ther t|he |French|man had| f|o|u|nd |out| t|hat| he| was| |a |d|etective|.
|But had |he |told h|is ma|ster|?  W|hat |p|a|rt |was |he |play|ing |in a|ll thi|s:

several| |hours| |turn|i|ng| |these |thing|s |over| in |h|is |m|ind|, s|o|me|times|
|thinking th|at |all was |lost|, |the|n pers|uading| |hi|mself| |th|at |Fogg|
w|as i|gn|orant |of |his |p|r|esence|, and| |then |unde|cided| |what cou|rse|
|it| was |be|st t|o |t|ake|.

|Nevertheles|s|, h|e p|re|served his |co|oln|ess| o|f |mind|, and |a|t l|ast|
reso|lved t|o d|e|al |p|lain|ly |with |Passepartout|.|  |I|f |he |did not| f|ind |it
|practicable t|o a|rrest| |Fogg| |at |Hong Kong|, |and i|f |Fo|gg m|ade pre|par|ation|s

would be t|o a|bandon| the |r|obber.

S|uch was t|he |si|t|uation |be|tween |Fix| and |Passepartout|.  |Meanwhile |Phileas Fogg|
|m|oved about a|bo|ve th|em| in| the |m|ost |maje|sti|c and un|conscious| indifference|.
|He was passing |methodically in |his |orb|it |a|round| the |world|, |re|gardless| of|
th|e |l|ess|er st|ars w|hich gr|av|i|tated |a|round |hi|m.|  |Yet the|re| was n|ea|r by |what

faile|d to |ac|t|, |to |Passepartout|'s |g|reat| |surpr|ise|; |and |th|e |d|isturb|ances|,
|i|f |th|ey |existe|d, would |have| |been |more di|fficult| to |cal|culate| tha|n| th|ose
of |Uranus which |l|ed to| the d|iscovery| of |Neptune|.

|It w|as e|v|ery |day| |an |in|creasing w|o|nder| t|o |Passepartout|, |w|ho| read|
i|n |Aouda|'s eyes| the d|e|pth|s| of |her gratit|ude| |to h|is| |master|.
|Phileas Fogg|, th|ough| brave and |ga|ll|ant, m|ust be|, he |t|hought|,

|On|e |day |he |was |lea|ning |o|n the |r|ail|ing| of the |engi|ne|-roo|m|,

|
"|Th|e valves |are |not suffi|cient|ly |c|harged|!"| he exclaimed|.  |"|We are

|IN WHICH |P|HILEAS FOGG|, |P|ASSEP|ART|OU|T|, |A|ND |F|I|X |GO |EA|CH |A|BOUT |HIS| |BUSI|NE|SS


|Th|e |wea|ther| was |b|ad d|uring the| |l|atter| |days o|f the| |voyage|.
|The| w|ind|, obst|inate|ly |re|maining |in th|e |north|-west|,| bl|ew| a| g|ale|,
a|nd |re|ta|rd|ed th|e st|eamer|.|  |The |Rangoon rolled |heavily| a|nd the|
p|assengers| |became impatient of the |long|, |m|onstrous w|aves| which
t|he w|ind r|aised before| the|ir p|ath|.  A s|ort of t|empest| a|rose| on|
the| |3rd of November, |th|e |squa|ll |knock|ing th|e vessel about |w|ith| fur|y,
and| |th|e w|ave|s |r|unning hi|gh.  |The| |Ra|ngoon r|eefe|d all |h|er |sails|,| and |e|ve|n|
the r|igging p|roved| t|oo |much|, w|hi|stl|ing an|d |sh|ak|ing amid| the |s|qua|ll|.
|The| st|eamer was |forced |to |pr|oceed slowly, |and th|e |captain |e|stimated
that |she |w|ould |re|a|ch| Hong Kong| twenty| hours| be|hind| time|, and| |more|
|if the |stor|m l|asted.|

|Phileas Fogg| |ga|zed a|t| the t|empestuous |sea|, w|hich |seemed to |be| |struggl|ing
especially t|o de|lay| him|, |with| hi|s |ha|bitual tranquil|li|ty.|  |He| ne|ver c|han|ged|
c|o|unt|enance| |fo|r |a|n instant|, t|hough| |a |delay| of |twenty| |hours|, |by |ma|king| |hi|m
|to|o| late |for |the |Yokohama| |bo|at, |would |al|m|ost i|nevitabl|y |cause| th|e| l|oss|
|of the w|ager|.  |But| th|is |man of n|e|rve |manifested n|ei|th|er| i|mpatience
|nor a|n|n|oyance|; it seeme|d a|s if |the| |storm |w|ere a |p|art of |his |programme|,
|and h|ad been |fo|reseen.  |Aouda was |amazed to |find |him| as |cal|m a|s |he had| been
|f|rom |th|e |f|irst| |time| s|he |s|aw h|im|.|

|Fix did not |l|ook| |at th|e |state of th|ings| in |the |same |light|.
|Th|e |storm| gr|eat|ly pl|eased| |him|.  H|is sa|tisfaction| w|ould have|
been co|m|plete| h|ad t|he |Rangoon| been f|orce|d to |re|treat| b|e|fore|
t|he viole|nce| of wind |a|n|d w|aves.  |Each delay f|illed| him| |w|ith| ho|pe,
f|or |it beca|me |more |and more |pr|obab|le| that| Fogg w|ould |be obliged|
to |remain |some d|ays| at |Hong Kong|; and| |now th|e |h|eavens| t|he|msel|ves|
b|ecame h|is |al|l|ies, |with the| gu|st|s and s|qual|l|s.  |It |ma|ttered not|
|th|at the|y |m|ade |hi|m |s|ea|-s|ick|--h|e m|ad|e |no |acc|o|unt |of |th|is| incon|venience|;
|and|, |whils|t hi|s b|ody w|as wri|th|ing |under |the|ir |effect|s,| his sp|ir|it| b|oun|ded
with| |hopeful exultat|ion|.

|Passepartout |w|as| e|nra|ged |beyond exp|ression| by the unpr|o|pitio|us w|ea|ther|.
|E|verything| |had |gone so| |well| t|ill now|!  |Ear|th a|nd |s|ea| had |se|emed| to |be
|a|t h|is |master's |s|erv|ice; steamer|s a|nd ra|ilways| obey|ed |hi|m|; wind and s|te|am
|un|ited to s|peed hi|s journ|ey|.  |Had |th|e h|our of a|dve|rsi|ty |co|me|?
|Passepartout| was| |as |much e|xcited| |a|s |if |the| t|wenty| t|housand| pounds|
w|e|re to com|e |from |his own p|ocket|.|  The s|torm |ex|as|pe|rated| him|,|
|t|he ga|le |m|ade |hi|m fur|ious|, |and |he| l|onged| to |la|sh the |obstinate s|ea
|into |o|be|dience|.  |Poo|r f|ellow|!  |Fix| |care|fully |con|cealed| from hi|m
hi|s own |satisfaction|, |for|, |had| he b|et|rayed| |it|, |Passepartout| c|ould|
|scarce|ly have |re|str|ained h|i|mself| from |pe|r|sonal| viole|nce.|

|Passepartout| r|emained on |deck| as |lo|ng| as |the| |tempest| lasted|,
be|ing u|nable |to rem|ain quiet| below|, a|nd |tak|ing |it |in|to |hi|s h|ead|
t|o aid the |pro|g|ress| of |the |ship| by len|di|ng a| |hand| w|ith |the| |crew.|
|He overwhelmed |the |captain|, |off|icer|s, |and |sailors|, who| |co|uld| not|
|hel|p l|aughing at his i|mp|atience|, with| |all| sorts of |question|s|.|
|He |wa|nted t|o |know| e|xactly h|ow lo|ng| the |st|orm| was g|oing| |to last|;
w|hereupon he was |ref|er|red to the b|arometer|, |w|hich |s|eemed to have|
n|o| |inte|ntion of rising|.  |Passepartout| |s|ho|ok| it|, |b|ut |w|ith| no|
|per|cepti|ble |eff|ect|; f|or |neither |sha|king nor |male|dictions|
|co|uld prev|a|il u|pon |it to| |ch|ange| |its m|ind|.|

|On the |4th|, h|owever, t|he se|a| beca|me |more |calm, and th|e |stor|m|
l|essened |it|s |v|iolence|; |the| w|ind veer|ed |south|ward|, |and |was o|n|ce
more |fa|vour|able|.  |P|assepartout| |cleared| up |with the| |w|ea|ther.|
S|ome of the s|ails were |u|nfurl|ed, and |the| Rangoon r|e|sumed |it|s|
|m|ost |r|apid speed|.  |The t|ime l|o|st |co|uld not|, however|, |be| re|ga|ined|.
|La|nd |was |no|t |signal|le|d until |five o|'clock| o|n the| morning| o|f the |6th|;
|the| ste|amer| w|as |due| |on th|e |5th.|  |Phileas Fogg |was |twenty|-four hours|
behind|-hand, |and th|e| |Yokohama| steamer| w|ould|, of| course|, be m|issed|.

|The p|ilot| went |on board| |at |six|, and |t|ook |his p|lace |on the b|ridg|e|,
|to guide the |Rangoon| t|hrough the |ch|annels to |the po|rt of |Hong Kong|.
|Passepartout| l|o|nge|d to |ask |him if |the steamer| |had |left |for |Yokohama|;
but| he |dar|ed| not|, |for |he w|ished to |p|rese|rv|e |the sp|ar|k of |ho|pe,|
w|hi|ch |s|till rem|ained| ti|ll the| las|t| moment.|  He had |c|onfide|d
|his |anx|iety to |Fix |who|--th|e |sly |ras|ca|l|!|--t|ri|ed t|o co|nsol|e h|im|
|by saying t|h|at |Mr. Fogg |w|ould| be |in t|ime| i|f h|e |took t|he| next |boa|t|;
|but| th|is only p|ut |Passepartout| |in |a |pas|sion|.

|Mr. Fogg|, |bold|er| t|han |his |s|erv|ant|, |did not |hesitate |to |a|pp|r|oach| th|e| pi|lot|,
a|nd |tr|a|nquil|l|y |a|sk| hi|m if |he k|new |wh|e|n |a |st|eam|er w|ould leave| |Hon|g Kong|
|for Yokohama|.

|"At |high tide| |to|-morrow m|orning|,|" a|nswered |the |pilot|.|
|
"|Ah|!" said |Mr. Fogg|, w|ith|out |be|traying |any |as|tonis|hment|.

|Passepartout|, wh|o h|eard w|hat |passed|, |would |willingly have |embraced t|he p|ilot,
|w|hile Fix |would |have |been |gl|ad to |twist |his n|eck.

|"What i|s the s|teamer|'s |na|me|?" |asked |Mr. |Fogg|.

"|The| Carnatic|."

"|Ou|ght she| not t|o |have g|on|e yest|erday|?"

"|Ye|s|, sir|; but |th|ey had to |repa|ir o|ne o|f |her boilers,|
|and |so he|r| de|parture| w|as postponed |till to|-morrow.|"

|"|Th|ank| you," re|turned |Mr. Fogg|, |de|scend|ing m|at|hematically| to |the |saloon|.

|P|assepartout| c|la|sped| the |p|ilo|t's hand and |shook i|t h|ea|rtily| in |his deli|ght|,
|ex|claiming|, "|P|ilot, you |a|re the |best of g|o|od |fellow|s|!|"

|Th|e pilot| pr|o|babl|y d|o|es no|t |know |t|o |th|is |day| why| |his |res|pon|ses
|w|on hi|m this |ent|husiast|ic g|re|eting|.|  |He |r|emou|nted| the b|r|idge|,
|and guided the |steam|er| th|rough the |flo|tilla of ju|nks|,|
|tan|kas, |and |f|ishing| bo|ats w|hich |c|rowd th|e |harbour of |Hon|g Kong|.
|
|At |one o'clock the| Rangoon |was at| the |qu|ay|, and the p|a|ssengers|
were |going |ashore|.|

|Cha|nce had str|an|ge|ly f|avoured |Phileas Fogg|, |for |had not t|h|e|
|Carnatic |been |for|ced| t|o |lie over for r|epairing h|e|r |bo|iler|s,
|she would |have |left |on |the |6th| of |November|, and the| |p|assenger|s
|for |Japan |would |ha|ve been |ob|liged to |a|wait| for |a |w|e|ek| t|he |sailing|
|of |the |ne|xt steamer|.  |Mr. Fogg| w|as|, i|t |is |true|,| twenty|-four hou|rs|
|behi|nd| hi|s |t|im|e|; |but th|is co|uld |not |se|ri|ously| |imp|er|il t|he|
r|emainder of his t|our.|

|Th|e |st|eamer| w|hich cr|oss|ed |the |Pa|cific fr|om |Yokohama to Sa|n Francisco|
|ma|de a| |di|rect| c|onnection |with |th|at| |from |Hong Kong|, and |i|t |could |not| |s|ail|

in |the |voya|ge| of t|wenty|-t|wo |days| a|cro|ss| the |Pacific|.  |He |found| himself|,
th|en, a|bout |tw|enty|-|four hours| |be|hind|-hand|, t|hirty-|five days|
a|fter |leaving |London|.

|The |Carnatic| w|as |announced |t|o |leave |Hon|g Kong| at |fi|ve |the next m|orning|.
|Mr. Fogg| |had| |sixteen |hours |in which t|o a|tt|end| t|o hi|s b|usiness there|,|
w|h|ich was |t|o |de|pos|it| |Aouda| sa|fely w|ith h|er| we|al|thy relative|.

|On l|a|nding|, he |co|nd|uc|ted |her| t|o |a| pala|nquin|, |in which| the|y|
|re|pair|ed to |the |Clu|b| Ho|t|el|.|  A |room was e|ngaged| for the |young woman|,
and |Mr. Fogg|, |a|fter |see|ing t|hat s|he w|ant|ed| for not|hing, |se|t out| |in s|earch
|o|f h|er co|usin |Je|ejeeh|.|  |He instructed |Passepartout| t|o |re|main| at the |hotel
|u|ntil his |re|turn, |that |Aouda| might not| |be |left |enti|rely alone|.

|Mr. Fogg| |repa|ired to |the |Exch|an|ge, |wh|ere|, he did not |doubt|,
every o|ne| wo|uld k|now |s|o w|ealthy a|nd con|si|derable| |a| p|er|sonage|

t|o |lea|rn that |J|eejeeh| ha|d |left |China| two |yea|rs b|efore|, and|, re|tiring|

t|o the |ho|tel|, |be|gged a| moment|'s c|onversation| with |Aouda|,| and w|ith|out
m|ore| |ado, |apprised| her| th|at| |J|eejeeh| w|as |no| longer| at |Hong Kong|,

|Aouda at |first| |sa|id| nothing|.  |She |passed |her ha|nd |acros|s he|r forehead|,|

|"Monsieur|."

"|Go to the |Carnatic|, |and engage| |thr|ee c|a|bins|."

|A|ND| |WH|AT |COME|S O|F |IT|

|Ho|n|g Kong |is |an |island w|hi|ch c|ame |in|to |the |p|os|se|ssion of |th|e|
|English |by| th|e Treaty| of |Nan|kin, a|fter |the |w|ar of |1|8|42;|
and the |col|on|is|i|ng g|en|i|us of the |E|nglish |h|as |c|re|ated| upon |it|
|an i|mportant c|it|y and |a|n| ex|c|elle|nt| |p|ort|.  The |island i|s si|tuated
|a|t |the m|outh| of the |C|ant|on |River|, and |is se|parated |by |about |six|ty| miles
from |the |Portug|uese t|own of| |Ma|ca|o, on the |opposit|e c|oast.|  |H|ong Kong|
|ha|s be|a|te|n |Ma|ca|o |in the s|t|ruggle| for the| |Chinese| |trade|, and now|
|t|he g|reat|er| part |of the |tra|nsportat|ion of |Chinese |goods| f|ind|s
|i|ts |dep|ot| at th|e fo|rm|er p|la|ce|.  |Docks|, |ho|sp|it|als, w|harves,|
|a |Gothic cathedral, a government h|ouse|, |ma|cadamised |stre|ets,|
give| t|o |Hong Kong| t|he |a|ppear|ance| o|f a t|own |in |Kent or |Surrey|
t|ransferre|d by |some s|tr|a|nge m|agi|c to the a|nt|ipo|des.|
|
|Passepartout| wa|ndered|, |with |h|is |hands| in |hi|s |p|ocket|s, |to|wards the|
|Vi|ctoria port|, ga|zi|ng a|s |he |went a|t |the |curious pala|nqu|ins|
|and |o|the|r |mo|des| o|f |conveyance|, |a|nd| th|e| |groups of |Chinese|, |Japan|ese|,
and| |European|s w|ho| p|assed |to |and |fro |in |the |s|tr|eet|s|.|  H|o|ng Kong| s|ee|med
|to |him| not |unl|ike| |Bombay|, Calcutta|, |and S|ingapore|,| |si|nce|, |l|ike| |the|m,
|it betrayed e|very|where the| |e|vidence of |Engl|ish |supremacy.|
|At |th|e |Victoria| p|o|rt| he |found |a co|nf|used |ma|ss of sh|ips| of |all nation|s|:
|E|ngl|ish, |Fre|nch|, America|n, a|nd |Du|tch, m|en-o|f-wa|r a|nd t|ra|ding |v|essel|s|,
|Japan|ese| |and |Chi|nese |ju|nks|, |s|empas, t|ankas, and f|lower|-boa|t|s,
wh|ich |for|med so many float|ing| |pa|r|terr|es.  |P|assepartout| n|oticed|
in| the |cr|owd| a |number of |the native|s w|ho |seemed |very |o|ld|
|and w|e|re |d|ress|ed |in |yellow|.  |On g|oing in|to| a b|arb|er's
t|o |get| sh|aved h|e |learned that the|se an|cient men| were |all|
a|t |least eighty| years| old|, |a|t |which |age |th|e|y |a|re| p|er|mi|tted|
t|o |w|ear y|ellow, |which |is |th|e |Imperi|al |c|olo|ur|.  |Passepartout|,
|w|ithout |exactly |knowing why|, |thought| th|is very |f|un|ny.|

|On reaching the |qu|ay| whe|re the|y |were to embark| o|n the |Carnatic|,|
|he |was |not |a|stonished| to |find |Fix |wa|lking| |up a|nd down|.
|The| detective| s|eem|ed v|ery muc|h |dis|t|urb|ed| a|nd |di|sapp|ointed|.

|"|This is bad,|" muttered |Passepartout|, "|fo|r |the g|entlem|en |of|
t|he |Reform Club|!" | He a|cco|sted| |Fix| w|ith| |a |merry s|mi|le|,| a|s if |he|
had |not |per|ceived| that |gentleman|'s |chagrin|.  |The |de|tective| had|, i|ndeed,|
good |reason|s to |in|ve|igh| a|gainst| t|he |ba|d |lu|ck |which p|u|r|sued| |hi|m|.
|The |war|rant| had no|t |com|e|!  |It was certain|ly on |the wa|y|,|
|but |as certain|ly |i|t |c|ould not no|w |re|ach |Hong Kong| for |s|everal| d|ays|;
|and|, th|is being the| |last |English| |te|rritory| o|n |Mr. F|ogg's rou|te,
|th|e |robber| w|ould |esc|ap|e|, |un|less| |he |co|uld |manage| t|o |detain| him|.|
|
|"|Well, |Monsieur Fix|,|" said |Passepartout|, |"have you |de|cided| to| go| |with u|s|
so| far as |America|?"

"|Yes|," re|turned |Fix|, |t|hro|ugh| his |set |teeth.|

|"Good|!|" |exclaimed| Passepartout|, |laughing |he|artily.
|"I knew |you c|ould not |p|ersuade| you|rself| to| separate from u|s|.
|Come |and |engage y|our b|erth.|"

|They |entered |the |s|teamer| |o|ff|ice| a|nd| s|ec|ur|ed |c|abin|s for |fo|u|r p|erson|s.

|
"|Th|at |w|ill sui|t my master |all| th|e |better|," said |Passepartout|.
|"|I |will |go| a|nd |let |hi|m know|.|"

|Fix| now |d|ecided to make |a |bo|ld |move|; |he |re|solved| t|o |t|ell| |Passepartout| all|.
|I|t |seemed t|o be |the |only p|oss|ible |means of |keeping |Phi|leas| Fogg| se|veral| d|ays|
lo|nger |a|t |Hong Kong|.|  |He |acc|ording|ly |invited hi|s |companion| |into |a |tavern
|w|hich caught| his eye| on |the| |quay|.  |On en|teri|ng|, |they |found| the|mselves|

|some |thirty| c|ustomers were |drinking Engl|ish| bee|r, |po|rter, gin, |and b|r|andy|;
smoking|, |the |wh|ile|, |long red c|lay pipes s|tu|ff|ed |w|ith |litt|le |ba|lls| o|f opium|

|Opium is |s|moke|d every|where|, a|t all |time|s|, |by m|en |and |w|om|en|,

|Passepartout had no| money, b|ut| wi|lling|ly acc|epted| Fix|'s in|v|i|tation
in| the| h|ope| of |re|turning t|he |obligat|ion |at |some |future| time.

|The|y |o|rd|er|ed two |bo|ttles |of p|ort, t|o |wh|ich| |the |Frenc|hman| di|d |am|ple| |justi|ce|,

|h|e rose to |go and |tell| |hi|s master| o|f |th|e |cha|n|ge |in |th|e |time|
|of |the| sail|ing| o|f |the |Ca|rnatic|.
|
|F|ix |c|aught |him| |b|y |the arm, |and said|, "|Wa|it a mo|me|nt."

|"|Wh|at| for|, |Mr. |Fix|?"

"|I| want t|o |have |a ser|ious t|alk| |with| you|."

"|A s|er|ious t|alk|!" cried |Passepartout|, |drinking up |the l|ittle| wi|n|e
t|hat w|as |l|eft in the bo|tt|om| of |his |g|la|ss|.  |"Well|, w|e'll |tal|k|

"|Sta|y!  |What| I have |t|o say co|nce|rns| your |m|aster|."

|Passepartout|, |at this,| l|ook|ed at|tenti|vely| at |his |companion|.
|Fix|'s |fac|e seem|ed |to have |a singular |ex|press|ion|.  |He| r|e|s|umed| |his |sea|t.
|
|"|What is it that |you| have |t|o |say|?"
|
|Fix placed |his ha|nd |upon |Passepartout|'s |arm, |and|,
l|owering his voice|, s|aid, "|You |have |guessed| |wh|o |I a|m?|"

|"|Parb|leu!" |said |Passepartout|, |smil|ing.|

|"The|n I|'m go|ing t|o t|e|ll |you |eve|ry|thing|--"

|"|No|w t|hat| I know| eve|ry|thing|, m|y |friend|!  A|h|! |that|'s |very g|ood|.

|"|Useless|!"| said |Fix|.  |"You |speak |co|n|fident|ly.|  |It's c|lear |that|
|you don|'t know| |how| |l|arge the s|um| |is."

|"|O|f |course| I do|,|" re|turned |Passepartout|.|  "|Twenty| thousand pounds|."

"|Fi|fty-|five thousand|!" answered |Fix|, |pre|ssing| his |companion|'s hand|.
|
|"|What|!"| cried the |French|man|.  "|Has Mo|nsieur |Fogg dared-|-
fi|fty|-five |thousand |pounds|!  |Well|, |there|'s |all th|e more |r|eas|on|
|for |n|ot lo|s|ing an instant|," he |cont|inued, g|et|ting up |hast|ily|.
|
|Fix |pushed |Passepartout| ba|ck| i|n his |chair, |and |re|s|um|ed|:
"|Fi|fty-five thousand| |pounds|; |and i|f |I succ|eed|, |I get two| thousand| pounds|.
|If you'll |help| me|, |I|'ll let you |have |five |hundred |of |the|m|."

|"|Help you|?" |cried |Passepartout|, |who|se |eyes| w|ere |st|a|nding| wi|de| open|.

"|Yes;| help me |keep |Mr. Fo|gg |here| |fo|r |two |or |th|r|e|e days|."

|"|Wh|y, w|hat |are |you |saying?|  |Those |gentlemen| a|re |not s|atisfied|

"W|hat| do| you m|ean|?"

"I |m|ea|n |that| |it| is |a |piece |of |shameful trick|er|y.|  |Th|ey might|

|"|That|'s just what |we c|ou|nt| o|n d|oing|."

"|It|'s a| c|ons|p|iracy|, th|en|," |cried |Passepartout|, |w|ho| |became more|
a|n|d m|ore |ex|cit|ed |as| t|he l|iquor| |mounted| in |hi|s |hea|d|, |for |he |d|rank|
w|ith|out per|ceiving| i|t.  |"A| real| con|spiracy|!  |An|d gentlemen|, too|. Bah!|"

|Fix be|gan t|o |be |pu|zzled|.

|"|Member|s o|f| the |R|eform |C|lub|!" |continued |Passepartout|.  "|You must know|,
|M|on|sieur| Fix|, |th|at my| m|aster is| |an |honest| man|, and |that|,
|when |he |ma|kes |a w|a|ger, he |t|rie|s to |w|in it| fai|rly|!"

"|But |wh|o |do |you th|ink| I |am|?"| asked |Fix|, |look|ing a|t |hi|m |inte|ntly.
|
|"Parb|leu!|  An| a|gent o|f the |me|mbers of the R|eform| Club|, |sent |out| her|e

I|'|ve |take|n| go|od care| t|o |say| nothing| a|bout |it| to| |Mr. |Fogg|."

"|He| kn|ow|s| not|hing, then|?"

"|Nothing,|" replied| |Passepartout|, again| e|mptying |his |gl|ass.|

|The |detectiv|e| passed |his |ha|nd| across h|is |for|ehead|, he|sitating |be|fore
|he sp|o|ke |a|gain|.  |Wh|at s|h|ould |he |d|o?|  |Passepartout|'s m|i|stake| seemed| s|incere,

w|as not |t|he |master|'s ac|com|plice|, |as |Fix had been in|cl|ined to |suspect|.
|
|"Well,|" said |the detective| to h|imself|, "|as |he is| |not an a|cc|o|mplice|,
h|e w|il|l h|elp| me|."

He |had no| time to |lose|: Fogg |m|ust be |de|ta|ined| at Hong Kong|,
|so h|e |re|solved t|o |make |a |cl|ea|n br|ea|st| of |it|.

|"|Listen |to me|," said |Fix| a|b|rupt|ly.  "|I am |no|t, as |you |th|ink,|
a|n a|gent of the |me|m|bers of |the| Reform| Club|--|"

|"|Ba|h!|" |ret|orted Passepartout|, |w|ith| an |air| of ra|il|le|ry.

|"|I |am |a |police| |detective|, s|ent |out here| |by the |London| off|ice|."

|"You|, |a |detective?|"

"I |will pro|ve| i|t.|  Here| is |my| c|om|miss|ion|."

"|Listen.  |On| the |28th of l|ast |September| a r|obbe|r|y of f|ifty|-fi|ve |thousand| pounds|

"|W|hat| |no|nse|ns|e|!" |cried |Passepartout|, |s|t|riking t|he| t|able| w|ith |hi|s f|is|t|.
|"M|y ma|ster| |is| the |m|ost honourable of |m|en!"

|"How c|an you t|ell|?  |You |kn|ow sc|arcely| |a|nything| a|bout |him.|  You| w|ent into

"|Would you |li|ke |to be |arr|est|ed| a|s |h|is |acc|o|mpli|ce|?"

|P|assepartout|, o|vercome b|y |what h|e had| he|ard|, held hi|s h|ead|

|"W|ell,| what| do| you want| o|f |me|?"| said |he|, |at l|ast|, |with| |an| e|ffort|.

|"|S|e|e he|re|," replied |Fix|; "I have tracked |Mr. Fogg| to th|is pla|ce|,

IN WHICH |FI|X| |COMES F|ACE |TO |F|ACE |WIT|H P|HILEAS FOGG|
|

|Wh|ile |the|se e|ven|ts| were pas|sing |at |th|e |op|ium-house|, |Mr. Fogg|,|
un|conscious| of t|he d|anger| h|e was |in| |of |losing| the |st|eam|er|,|
was |qui|et|ly |e|scort|i|ng |Aouda| about |the| str|eets| of the |English |quarter,|
|ma|king the n|ecessary| p|u|rchase|s| f|or |th|e| long |vo|yage| b|efor|e| the|m.
|It |w|as| |a|ll v|ery |well |for| an |English|man| li|ke Mr. Fogg| |to |ma|ke |the|
|tour| of the |world| |with| a c|arpet-bag|; a| l|ady could not| be| |ex|pected
|t|o |trave|l |co|m|fortabl|y under s|uch cond|ition|s.|  He a|cquitted|
|hi|s |task |with| c|ha|racte|ri|stic s|eren|ity|, |and |i|nva|r|iably re|plied
t|o t|he |remonstrance|s of h|is f|air |com|panion|, |who| was |co|nf|used|
b|y h|is |patienc|e| and |g|enero|sity|:

|"I|t is i|n| |the i|nter|es|t of |my journey-|-a p|art of my pro|gr|amm|e|."

The |p|ur|chase|s ma|de|, th|ey r|eturned |to |the h|o|tel|, |whe|re| |the|y
d|ined |a|t |a s|umptuous|ly |s|erv|ed |table-d'hot|e|; |after |which |Aouda|,
|s|hak|ing |h|and|s| w|ith he|r protector| a|fter| |the| |English| |fa|shion,|
|r|e|tired |to |her room |for |r|est.|  |Mr. Fogg| a|bsorbed| hi|mself| |through|ou|t
the even|in|g| in th|e per|usal of |Th|e |Times and |I|ll|ustrat|ed London| News|.

|Had he been |c|apa|ble of| being |a|stonished| a|t any|thing|, |it |w|ould|
|have |been |not |t|o |see| hi|s |s|erv|ant| r|eturn| |at |bed|tim|e|.
|But|, |knowing th|at |the| |s|te|am|er |was |no|t |to |l|eave for Yokohama| u|ntil
the ne|xt morning|, he |di|d not |d|isturb |hi|m|self |about t|h|e |ma|tter|.
|When |Passepartout| d|id not |appear the |next |morning| |to |answer|
|hi|s |master|'s |bell|, |M|r. Fogg|, no|t betraying the |least| vexation|,
|c|ont|e|nted |hi|mself |wi|th |t|ak|ing his |carpet-bag|, |ca|ll|ing |Aouda|,
|and s|end|ing| for| a |p|al|anquin.

|It was t|hen eight |o'clock|; a|t half-past |ni|ne|, i|t |being the|n high|
ti|de|, |t|he |Carnatic| w|ould |leav|e th|e |h|arbour|.  |Mr. Fogg |a|nd |Aouda|
|got into |the |p|a|lan|quin|, |their |l|ug|gage| be|ing br|ought| a|fter on a |wheelbarrow|,
and ha|lf a|n ho|ur |later |s|tepped |upon the |qu|ay| wh|ence| the|y were| to| em|bark|.
|Mr. Fogg| th|en lear|ned that th|e| |Carnatic| had| s|a|il|ed t|he even|ing| before|.|
|He had expect|ed| t|o |find |not |only the| |steamer|, but h|is |domes|tic|,
|and |was |fo|rced t|o g|ive |up |bot|h; |but no| |si|gn of| d|isa|pp|oi|ntment| |app|ear|ed
on |h|is |face|, and |he |merely |re|marked t|o |Aouda|, "|It |is |a|n a|cc|ident|, m|adam|;
|not|hin|g |more|."

|At |thi|s moment| a ma|n who| h|ad |been |obs|erv|in|g |hi|m| atte|ntively| approac|hed|.
|It w|as| |Fix|, who, |bowing|, address|ed| Mr. Fogg|:  |"W|ere you not|,| like me|,
sir, a| p|ass|enger |by |the |R|angoon|, |wh|ich |a|rrived y|esterday|?"

"|I |was|, sir|," replied |Mr. Fogg| c|oldly|.  |"|But| I |have not |th|e ho|nour|--"

"|Par|don me|; |I thought| I sh|ould |find you|r servant| here."

|"|Do| you know| where |he |is|, s|ir|?|" asked |Aouda| a|nxiously.

"|W|hat|!|" responded |Fix|, |feigning |surprise|.  "|Is |he not |with |you?"|

"|No|,|" |said |Aouda|.|  "|He |ha|s not |m|ade his a|ppearance| |si|n|ce| yesterday|.
|Could he ha|ve gone| on board| t|he |Carnatic| w|ith|out |us|?"

"Wi|thout |you|, |mada|m|?"| a|nswe|red |the |detective|.  |"|Excuse |me, |di|d |you| in|tend|
|to |sail |i|n the |Carnati|c|?"

|"|Yes|, sir|."

|"So did |I, madam,| |and I am |exce|ss|ively |disapp|o|int|ed.  The| |Carnatic|,
|i|t|s r|epairs b|eing c|ompleted|, |left |Hong| Kong| twe|lve hours| before|
|the st|at|ed| t|ime|, |w|ithout |a|n|y |notice| be|ing |given|; and| |we mu|st now |w|ait
a| week| for |another steamer|.|"

|A|s he s|aid| "a |week|" |Fix| felt his |hear|t| leap for |jo|y.  |F|ogg| d|etained|
at |Hon|g Kong| for a w|eek|!|  The|re| would| be t|ime for the| warrant to |arrive|,
and |for|tune at |l|ast favoured the r|epresen|t|ati|ve of the law|.  |H|is |h|orror
|may |be |imagin|ed| when |he hea|rd| |Mr. Fogg| sa|y, in his |pl|acid |voice|,
|"But the|re |are o|ther vessel|s |be|side|s the |Carnatic|, |it s|eem|s to |me,
in| th|e |harbour of |Hong Kong|.|"

|And|, |off|e|ring |his |a|rm |to| Aouda|, |he |d|irect|ed| |his |step|s to|ward| th|e |docks|
|in| sea|rch |of |so|me |c|raft| about |to |star|t|.  |Fix|, stupe|fied|, |followed|;

|Chance|, |however, |app|ear|ed| |re|al|ly |to |have |abandon|ed| t|he m|an |it |had |hithert|o|

|with |the| |de|te|rm|i|na|tion|, |if n|ecessary|, |to |ch|ar|ter| a| ve|ssel| to |c|a|rry| hi|m
|to Yokohama|; |but |he |could |only fin|d vessel|s w|hich| were l|oad|ing| or unl|o|ading|,
and w|hich| c|o|uld not t|here|fore| |set| sa|il|.  F|ix |began to |h|ope |again|.

|But| |Mr. Fogg|, |f|ar |from |be|ing |discou|ra|ged|, |w|as |co|ntinui|ng| |his |s|earch,|
re|solved |no|t |to |stop |i|f |he had t|o| re|sort| t|o |M|acao|, |w|h|en he |w|as |ac|costed

"I|s your |honour| lo|oking |for |a |boat|?"|

"|Have you |a| boat re|ady to |sail|?"

"|Ye|s|, you|r honour|; |a |pi|lot|-b|o|at|--|No|. |4|3--|the |best in| t|he |h|arbour|."

"|Bet|ween e|ight and nine |kno|ts the |h|our.  |Will you lo|ok| at |her|?|"

|"|Yes|."

"|You|r honour w|ill |be |s|atisfied| |with |h|e|r.  |Is it f|or a |sea| e|xcu|rs|ion|?"

|"No|; |for a v|oyage|."

"A| v|oyage|?"

"|Yes|, will you agree |t|o |take me to |Yokohama|?"

|The| sa|ilor| le|aned o|n the |r|ailing|, |opened |his |eye|s wide|, and |s|aid|,
|"|Is your |honour| |joking|?"

"|No.|  |I hav|e m|issed the |Carnatic|, and |I |must| get to |Yokohama|

|"A|re you in |e|arnest|?"|

"|Very much |s|o|."

|The |pilot| w|alk|ed |away| a| li|ttle| d|istan|ce|, |and ga|zed o|ut to |s|ea|,

|Mr. Fogg |turn|ed to |Aouda| and |as|ked h|er|, "|You w|ould not| be afrai|d|,|

"|Not |with| you|, Mr. |Fogg," |was h|er answer|.

|The pilot| |now re|turned|, shu|ffling| hi|s ha|t in |hi|s hand|s|.

|"|W|ell, p|ilot|?" |said |Mr.| Fogg|.

|"|Well,| |your |h|onour|,|" replied |he|, |"I| c|ould not risk |my|self|, my m|en,|

|"On|ly sixteen hundred," |said |Mr. Fogg|.

|"|It's |the| |same |thin|g|."

|Fix |brea|thed |more |fr|ee|ly.|

"|But|,|" a|dded the p|ilot|, "|it |might be| arranged a|nother| w|ay.|"
|
|Fix c|eased |to br|eathe a|t a|ll|.

"H|ow|?|" asked |Mr. |Fogg|.

"|By going |to |Nagasaki|, a|t the e|xtre|m|e so|uth| of |Japan, or e|ven|
to |Shanghai|, which is |on|ly |eight h|undred |miles| |from |h|ere|.
|In g|oing |to |S|hanghai| we should not be| forced| to |sa|il| wide|

"|Thanks|, |sir; |I |was |about to |a|sk |th|e |f|avour|."

|"|Very well|.  |In half| an hour| we shall| go| o|n| board|."|

"|But| |po|or P|assepartout|?" ur|ged |Aouda|, who| |wa|s |much |d|is|turbed|
|by the servant|'s |disappearance|.|

|"I |shall d|o |all |I| |can |to| find |him|," replied |P|hileas Fogg|.

|W|hile Fix|, |in |a |feverish|, |ne|rvous| st|ate, repaired| to| the |p|ilot|-boat|,
|the others |direct|ed th|eir co|ur|se| to| the |police|-s|tation| at |Hong Kong|.
|Phileas Fogg| |the|re| gave |Passepartout|'s |d|es|cription|, and left a sum of money
|t|o be |sp|e|nt in |the |se|arch |for |him|. | |The| |same |f|or|malit|ies h|aving| |been| |g|one

|The |Tankade|re| was a| |nea|t |little |c|raft |of |t|wenty| tons,|

|Phileas Fogg| |a|nd |Aouda| |went on |board|, whe|re |the|y found |Fix

|The |detectiv|e| |had |a feeling akin t|o hu|miliat|ion| in pr|of|iting|

|

Chapter |XX|I

|IN WHICH |THE |MASTER| |OF |THE |"|TANK|A|DE|RE|" |R|UN|S
|GRE|AT R|IS|K| OF |L|O|SIN|G |A |RE|WA|RD| OF |TW|O |H|UN|DRE|D |P|OUN|DS


|Th|is voyage| of ei|ght hundred| |miles |was |a |peri|lous v|en|ture|
o|n |a c|ra|ft of |twenty| t|ons, and |a|t that s|ea|son| |of the |year|.
|The| C|hinese| |seas| are |usually boisterous, s|ubj|ect| t|o |t|erri|ble|
g|ales of| wi|nd|, and |especially |d|uring |the e|quinoxes;
and |it was |no|w early |November|.

|It w|ould clear|ly h|ave |been |to t|he |master|'s |a|dv|antage| to carry
|his pa|ss|enger|s to |Yokohama|, |si|nce |he |was |p|aid |a| certain| s|um pe|r| da|y;
|but he would |have |been |r|ash t|o a|ttempt such a| |v|oyage|, a|nd it was |imprudent
|e|ve|n t|o |att|empt |to |re|ach S|h|anghai|.  |But Jo|hn Bunsby| be|lie|ved| in the| |Tankadere|,
|wh|ich |ro|d|e on the |waves| l|i|ke a s|ea|gul|l|; an|d per|haps |he was |no|t |wrong.|
|
|Late |in the d|ay the|y |passed |th|rough |the| |ca|pricious| c|ha|nnels of |Hong Kong|,
a|nd th|e |Tankadere|, i|mp|elled |by |favour|able| |wind|s, co|nducted herself| a|dmir|abl|y.
|
|"I do| not |n|e|ed|, |p|ilot,|" |said |Phileas Fogg|, |w|hen |the|y |got |in|to|
the |open |sea, |"t|o advi|se you t|o u|se| |a|ll possible| |speed|."

|"|Tru|st me|, your |honour|.  |We a|re c|arrying| al|l| th|e |sail| th|e wind| w|ill let u|s.
|The |po|les w|ould |ad|d |not|hing|, |and |are only |used when we |are going |in|to| p|o|rt."

"|It|s your t|rade, |not mi|n|e, p|ilot|,| and |I |conf|ide i|n| you|.|"

|Phileas Fogg|, w|ith| body erect |and |legs |w|ide a|par|t, s|ta|nding|
|li|ke a |s|ailor|, ga|zed |with|out |s|t|agg|e|ring |at the| sw|ell|ing |w|a|te|r|s.|
|The young woman|, |who| was |s|eated |aft, |was p|ro|fou|ndly |affected|
|a|s s|h|e |lo|oked out upon |the |o|cea|n, |dar|kening |n|ow with| the tw|i|light,
o|n |which |s|he |had |v|entured |in so |fr|ail |a v|essel.|  |Above |he|r |hea|d|
|ru|st|le|d t|he w|hi|te| |sails, |whi|ch| seemed| |like| gr|eat |wh|ite| wi|ng|s|.
|The| b|oat|, carried |forward by the |wind|, |seemed |to b|e |fl|ying in| the |air|.
|
|Night ca|me|.  |The moon| was en|tering |her |f|irst |quarter, |and |he|r
i|n|sufficient |light |wo|uld |soon |di|e out| i|n t|h|e mist| on |the |ho|rizon|.
|C|lo|uds w|ere| |rising |f|rom the e|ast|, and |al|ready o|verc|ast |a part|
of th|e h|ea|vens|.

|The pilot| had hun|g out |his l|ight|s|, which| was |very| |necessary|
|in the|se s|e|as c|rowded with| |ve|ssel|s bo|und l|andward|; for| co|l|lisions
|are |not u|ncom|mon| occurrences,| and, |a|t the| |spe|ed s|he |w|as |g|oing|,
th|e l|east s|hock w|ould sh|att|er| |t|he| g|all|ant lit|tle |craft|.
|
Fix, |seated in the bow|, gave| h|imself |up to| meditation|.  |He k|ept a|pa|r|t
|from |his f|ellow|-t|ravellers|, |knowing |Mr. |Fogg's| |ta|citurn |ta|stes; be|sides,|
he |did not |quite |like| to |talk| to |the |m|an who|se| favour|s he| had |a|ccepted|.
|He |was thinking|, |too|, o|f t|he |f|uture.  |I|t |se|emed c|ertain| |that| |Fogg| would| |not|
stop |a|t |Yokohama|, |but would at on|ce| |tak|e the| bo|at f|or| |San Francisco|;
and| the |vast exte|nt of |America |would e|nsur|e him| impunit|y| a|nd |saf|ety.|
|Fo|gg|'s |pl|an |appeared t|o him| t|he |simple|st| i|n the |world|.|  I|n|stead |of |sailing|
|di|rectly |from |England| to |t|he |United| States|, l|ike a| c|om|mon| v|il|la|in,
|he had tr|aversed thre|e |qu|arters of the glo|be|, |so as to| |gain| t|he|
|American |con|tinen|t| mor|e surel|y|; |and there|, |after |thr|owing|
|the |police| of|f h|is t|rac|k|, h|e| w|ould quietly |en|joy hi|mself|
with |the |f|or|t|une s|tolen |from |th|e |bank|.  |But|, o|n|ce in the |United States|,
w|h|at |sh|ould |he|, |Fix, |d|o?  |Sh|ould he aband|on| th|is man|?  |No|, |a| hund|red| time|s| no!
|Unti|l he |had |s|ecu|red hi|s e|xtradition|, |he w|ould |not l|ose |sight of| him| f|or an hour|.
|It was |his |duty, and| |he would f|u|lfil i|t |to |the| |end|.|  |A|t all e|vents|,
|th|ere| was on|e t|hin|g| t|o |be th|an|kful for|; |Passepartout| was| |no|t |with| his |master|;
and| it |was |abo|ve a|ll i|mportant|, a|fter |the co|n|fidences| F|ix ha|d |im|part|ed |t|o |him|,
t|h|at th|e |servant |should| never |h|ave |s|peech| with h|i|s |master|.

|Phileas Fogg| |was |a|lso| |th|inking| |o|f |Pa|ssepartout|, |who had| |so|
|s|tra|n|gely disappeared|.|  |Look|ing |at th|e m|atter| from e|ve|ry p|oint| o|f |vi|ew|,
|it |did not |seem |t|o |h|im| impossible| th|at|, by |some| |m|istake|, t|he m|an mi|ght
|have |embarked| o|n the| |Carnatic| at t|he last| m|oment|; and |th|is was |a|lso
|Aouda|'s |o|pinion, |who |re|g|re|tted |v|ery mu|ch |the |loss of t|he| w|o|rthy |f|ellow|
to |whom |she owed so m|uch|.  |Th|e|y |m|ight| then |fin|d |him| a|t |Yokohama;
|for|, |if the Ca|rnatic| w|as |carrying |him| th|ither, |it |w|ould be e|as|y
|to a|s|ce|rtain i|f |he had |been| |on board|.|

|A |br|i|sk| b|reeze| a|rose |about| t|en o'clock|; |but|, th|ough| |it m|ight|
|have |been |pru|den|t |t|o |take |in| |a r|e|ef|, |the pilo|t,| a|fter ca|refully|
examining |the| |h|eavens|, |let |the c|raft |r|e|main| r|igged a|s be|fore|.
|The |Tankadere| b|ore |sail |admira|bl|y, |as |s|he |d|rew| |a| gr|eat de|al of| |water|,|
|and |every|thing wa|s |pr|epar|ed for |hi|gh| s|peed |in c|ase |of a| g|ale|.

|Mr. F|ogg |and |Aouda| d|escended| |into |th|e |cab|in a|t| m|idnight|,|
h|aving been already |preceded| by |Fix|, w|ho| h|ad |lai|n |down |on |on|e |of |the| cots|.
|The| |p|ilot |and c|rew |remained| on deck all| night|.

|A|t sunris|e the |next day|, |which was |8th No|vember|, |the |b|oat h|ad made
more than |on|e hundred |miles|.  |The| lo|g |indicated |a mean| speed| of bet|ween|
|ei|ght| and n|ine |miles|.  |The| |Tankadere| s|till |carried |al|l sail|,
|and w|as |accomplish|ing h|er gr|eate|st| c|apacity of speed|.|
|I|f th|e w|ind held |as |it w|a|s, the |chances |would be in |h|er| f|avour|.
|During the day| she |kept |al|ong the |c|oast|, |wh|ere |the| c|urr|ent|s |were| |favour|able|;
the |co|a|st|, i|rregular| i|n |pro|fil|e, and v|isible| some|times a|cross |the |clear|ings|,
w|as |at most |fi|ve |miles| dis|tant|.  |The sea w|as |l|ess |b|oisterous|,
|s|ince th|e |wind ca|me |o|ff l|and|--a for|tun|ate| circu|mstance |for |the| |boat|,
wh|ich w|ould |su|ff|er|, o|wing |to |it|s sm|all |to|nna|ge|, |by |a heavy |surg|e o|n |the |sea|.
|
Th|e br|eeze| s|ubsided |a l|ittle |towards noon|, |a|nd |set i|n| fro|m |the| s|outh|-west.
|The p|ilot p|ut |up his p|oles|, b|ut took the|m d|own again| with|in| |t|wo hours|,
|as |the w|ind| |fre|sh|ened up| |an|ew.|

Mr. Fogg| and |Aouda|, |ha|pp|i|ly una|ffected by the |ro|ughness| of the s|ea,
|at|e w|ith a g|ood |app|etite|, |Fix b|eing in|vit|ed |to shar|e |the|ir |r|epast|,
w|hich |he |accepted |with |sec|ret |c|hagri|n|.  |T|o |travel a|t this m|an's
exp|ens|e |and l|ive| upon |his |provisions |wa|s |not |p|ala|table| to |him.|
|Still, he| w|as |obliged| to |eat|, |and |so he |at|e.

|Wh|en the |meal wa|s |over, |he |took Mr. Fogg| a|par|t, a|nd| |sa|id|,|
"s|ir|"--th|is |"s|ir|"| s|c|or|ched h|is li|ps|, |and |h|e |had |to |cont|rol h|imself|
|t|o a|void |coll|aring th|is "gentleman"--"|sir|,| you |have been ve|ry kind

"|Let| us not |s|pe|ak o|f| th|at|, |sir|,|" replied |Mr. Fogg|.

|"|But|, |i|f I |in|sist-|-"

"|No|, sir|," rep|eated |Mr. Fogg|, in |a ton|e which |did not |a|dm|it| |of a|

|Fi|x, |as he |bowed|, |h|ad |a stifle|d f|ee|ling|, |and|, |go|ing| |forward,|
|w|he|re he e|nsconced himself|, d|id not |o|pen his |mo|uth |for the| |rest| of |the |day|.
|
|M|eanwhile| |the|y |were |progressing |f|am|ously|, |and| |John Bunsby| w|a|s

|B|y evening|, th|e l|o|g |show|e|d th|at |tw|o |hundred |and |twenty| mi|les| |ha|d been

to re|ach |Yokohama| without re|cord|i|ng |a|ny delay in |his journal|; i|n which| case|,
|the |m|any |misadventure|s w|hich |had o|vertake|n him| since |he left |London
|would |not |seriously |affe|ct| his jo|urney|.|
|
|The |Tanka|de|re entered the St|rai|t|s of |Fo|-Kie|n, wh|ich |separate
the |island| of |Formosa from the |Chinese c|oast|, |in |th|e small |hours|
o|f the |n|ight, |and| c|rossed the| |Tro|pi|c of |Canc|er.  Th|e |sea was |very|
r|ough in the straits|, |full |of e|ddies f|ormed by| the |cou|nt|er-|c|urr|ents|,
|and the c|hop|pi|ng |waves| br|oke h|er |co|u|r|se|, |w|hi|lst| it beca|me |very d|iff|icult|
to s|ta|nd o|n |de|ck.|

|A|t |day|break |the wind| |beg|an to |blow |hard| a|gain|, |and t|h|e |heavens|
|seemed to |predict a |g|ale|.  |The |b|arometer| |an|nounced| |a |spe|ed|y cha|nge|,
|th|e |mer|cury |r|ising a|nd f|alling c|a|pr|iciously; the |s|ea also|,|
|in the |south|-east|, r|aised l|ong s|urges| which in|dicated |a |tempest|.
|The |sun h|ad set the e|ven|ing |before| |i|n a |red| |m|is|t,|
i|n |the| |midst of |the |phospho|res|cent| |s|c|intillation|s of |the |o|cean|.|

|John |Bu|nsby| long| |exam|ined| |t|he |threatening| |aspec|t of the |heavens,
|mutter|ing| |indistinctly |be|tween| his |teeth|.  |At l|ast |he |sa|id |in a |lo|w |voice|
t|o |Mr. F|ogg|, |"Shall |I sp|eak o|ut| t|o |your| honour|?"

|"O|f course.|"

"|We|ll|, |we are going to h|ave a |squa|l|l.|"

"|Is |th|e |wind| north or south|?"| asked |Mr. Fogg| quietly|.

|"|So|uth|.  |L|ook|! a typ|hoon| is |com|ing |up|.|"

|"|Gla|d |it's |a |typhoo|n f|rom th|e |south|, |f|or |it w|ill |car|ry u|s |forward|."

"|O|h|, |i|f |you take it| |that |way|," said |John Bunsby|,| "I|'ve not|hing m|ore| t|o |say|."
John Bunsby's| s|u|sp|icions| were |co|n|f|irmed.  |A|t |a |les|s a|dv|anced s|ea|son| o|f t|he| |year|
t|he typho|on|, |according to |a |fa|m|ous| me|teorologi|st|, would |have| |pass|ed |aw|ay
|like a |luminous c|a|sca|de o|f e|lectric |flame;| but in th|e w|in|ter| |equi|n|ox
|it |was |to |be |f|eared| that |it would b|urst upon the|m with gr|eat |violence|.

|The| pilot |t|ook |his |p|r|eca|utions| |in |a|dvance|.  |He |re|ef|ed |all |sail|,
|the |pol|e-m|ast|s were d|isp|ense|d |with|; a|ll h|ands |we|nt |for|ward| to |the b|ow|s.|
|A| |si|ngle tr|iangu|lar s|ai|l|, of st|r|ong canvas|, w|as |h|oisted a|s |a stor|m-jib|,
s|o |as t|o h|old |the w|ind f|rom |behind|.  |The|n |they |wa|ited|.

|John |Bunsby| |had re|quest|ed| his |p|assenger|s |to g|o| bel|ow; |but |th|is|
|impr|isonment| in s|o |narrow| |a |sp|ace|, |with little |a|i|r,| and |th|e |b|oat

|Fix|, no|r Aouda| con|se|nted |t|o |leave |th|e d|eck|.

|The |st|o|rm| of ra|i|n |an|d |wind de|scen|ded| upon| the|m |towa|rds e|ight| o|'clock|.
|With b|ut it|s |bit of |sa|il|, |the |Tankadere| was |l|ifted like |a |fea|th|er| by a| |w|ind,
an| |idea |of |who|se violence| ca|n s|carcely |be |given|.  |To c|o|mp|are her speed|
to |four time|s t|hat| of |a l|o|comotive| |going |on| f|ull |steam| w|ould |be |below
th|e tr|uth.
|
|The| b|o|at| s|cu|dded |th|us |northward d|urin|g the |who|le d|ay,| b|or|ne on|
b|y |monstrous |waves|, preserv|ing a|lways|, |for|t|un|ately|, |a| sp|eed| e|qual

|the|se |mountain|s o|f |water w|hi|ch| r|ose |be|hind| h|e|r|; |but| the |ad|r|oit|

b|athed |in sp|ray|, |bu|t |the|y |submitted| t|o |it |philosoph|ically|.
F|ix| cursed i|t, no| |doubt|; |but Aouda|, w|ith| he|r e|yes| |fastened upon|
|her protector|, |wh|o|se |cool|ness| ama|zed |her|, |sh|owed| h|er|self| |wo|rthy
of |hi|m|, |and b|r|avely| |we|athered| th|e |st|or|m.|  |A|s for |Phileas Fogg|,|
|i|t seemed |j|ust as i|f the| |t|yp|hoon were| a| |p|art of |his |programme|.
|
|U|p to th|is |t|ime| |th|e |Tankadere had |al|ways he|ld |he|r cou|rse |to the north|;
but| towards eve|ning| the wind|, |ve|ering |thr|ee quar|ters|, b|ore d|own| |from
the| north|-w|est|.  Th|e |boat|, |now lying in the |tr|ough |of |the |w|a|ves|,|
s|h|ook and r|olle|d |ter|ri|bl|y; the| |sea| st|ruck her w|ith f|ear|ful v|iol|ence|.
|A|t night the t|empest |incr|eased i|n| violence.|  |J|ohn Bunsby| sa|w t|he a|pproach|
of da|rk|ness| and the r|ising of the |storm| with |dark| m|is|gi|ving|s.
|He |th|ought| a|while, |and |the|n a|sked |hi|s |c|re|w i|f |it was |not |time t|o |sla|cken| s|peed.
|A|fter| a| |co|nsultat|ion| |h|e |approached| Mr. Fogg, and| said|, "|I think|, you|r honour|,
|t|hat w|e should |do| well| t|o make for| o|ne| o|f the |port|s on the co|ast.|"

"|I| |think so| to|o|."

"|A|h!" said |th|e |pilot|.  "|But| |wh|ich one?"|

"|I know| of| b|ut one|,|" re|turned |Mr. Fogg| tran|quil|ly.

"|And| |th|at| i|s|--"

|"|Shan|ghai|."

|Th|e| pilot|, |at |fi|rst|, d|id not |seem| t|o |com|prehend|; |he |could|
|s|carce|ly r|e|a|lise |so m|uch d|ete|rmination| |and ten|ac|ity|.
|Th|e|n |he |c|r|ied, |"|We|ll|--ye|s!|  |Your honour| is |right|.|  |To |Shanghai|!"

S|o the |Tankade|re kept s|t|eadily| on h|er |no|rthw|ard track|.

|The| |night was r|eal|ly |te|rrible|; it w|ould be| a| mi|racle |if th|e|
|cr|aft |di|d not |fou|nd|er.  |Twice it |could |have |been |a|l|l |over| w|ith| h|e|r
i|f |the| |c|rew| ha|d no|t |been |co|nstantly |on the wa|tch.  Aouda| was exhausted|,
|but di|d not |utter| a| |co|mplain|t.|  More| than o|nce |Mr. Fogg| |r|ushed|
t|o |pr|o|tect |h|er from |t|h|e |viole|nce| of |the w|aves.|

|Day re|appeared.  |The tempest| |st|ill |ra|ged |with undim|ini|she|d f|ury|;
|but |the w|ind |now re|turn|ed| t|o |the |s|o|u|th-east.|  |I|t was |a favour|a|ble| c|hange|,
|and |the |Tankadere| a|ga|in| b|o|unded for|ward on |th|is m|ountain|ous s|ea,
|th|ough| |the| w|aves |cr|oss|ed |each other|, |a|nd |i|mp|ar|ted |sh|ocks| |and cou|nte|r-s|ho|cks
which w|ould have |crushed |a |cra|ft| less| |solidly built|.  From t|ime| to t|ime|
t|he| co|ast| w|as |visible| t|hrough the br|oken| m|ist|, but| no| ve|ssel |was |in |sight.
|T|he |Tankade|re |was |a|lone u|pon the| |sea|.

The|re| w|ere |s|o|me |s|igns o|f a| |c|a|lm |at noon|, and| |the|se became m|ore |di|stin|ct|
|as |t|he s|un| d|escended |toward| the hor|izon|.  |The| tempest| |had been| |a|s br|i|ef
as |t|erri|fic.  |The |passengers|, |th|orough|ly e|xhaust|ed|, |c|ould now |eat| a l|ittle|,
a|nd t|ak|e |some| re|pos|e|.

|The |night was |co|mp|ar|ati|vely |quiet|.  |Some| of the |s|ail|s were |a|gain |hoist|ed|,
and |th|e |s|peed of the| boat| |was v|ery |go|od|.  The| n|ext morning| a|t dawn
th|e|y esp|ied |the| co|ast|, a|nd |John Bunsby| |was| able| to |a|ss|ert th|at| the|y w|ere|
|no|t o|ne h|undred |miles| from |Shanghai.|  |A hundred |miles|, |and o|nly |on|e| d|ay
|to |tra|ve|rse |the|m!  |That |very |evening Mr. Fogg w|as |d|ue| a|t |S|hanghai|,
i|f |he |did| not |w|ish to m|iss |the st|eamer| to |Yokohama|.  |Had |t|he|re| been |no s|torm|,

|The |wind| gre|w| d|ecided|ly cal|mer, |and |ha|pp|i|ly the| sea| f|ell |with |it|.
|All sails| were now |hoisted|, |and a|t |noo|n the |Tankadere| was |within|
|for|ty|-five |mi|les| of| |Shanghai|.  The|re remained| yet| s|ix| hours|
|in wh|ich |to |ac|complish |th|at| d|ist|ance|.  A|ll on |board| fea|red
|th|at it cou|ld |not |be| |d|one|, |and e|very| o|ne|--|P|hileas Fogg|, no| d|oubt|,
e|xcept|ed-|-f|elt |his h|ea|rt| bea|t w|ith impatience|.  |The| b|oat| must |keep up|
|an av|er|age| of n|ine m|iles| |an hour|, |and t|he |wind |w|as |b|ecoming c|al|m|er
|every mo|ment|!  |It |was| |a| capricious| b|re|eze|, |coming |from |the| c|oast,|
and |after |it p|ass|ed the |se|a| became s|mooth.  |Still, the |Tankadere|
w|as |so| |light|, |and h|e|r |fine |sail|s c|augh|t th|e |fickle |zeph|yrs |so| |w|ell|,

|two |hundred pounds| |was e|v|idently |on the po|int| of |escapi|ng| h|im|.|  He |loo|ked|
a|t |Mr. Fogg|.|  |Mr. Fogg| was |p|er|fectly |tranqui|l; and y|et |h|is whole |fo|rtune
w|as |at |th|i|s |m|oment |at stake|.

|A|t thi|s| moment|, |also, |a lo|ng bl|ack |f|unnel, c|rowned |with |wreaths| of s|m|oke|,
|a|ppe|ared on the |ed|ge of the w|at|er|s.|  |It was |the |American |steamer|,
|leaving |f|or |Yokohama| a|t the app|ointed time.

"Con|foun|d |her|!" |cried |John |Bunsby, |pushing back t|he |r|udder|
w|ith| a| |d|esperate j|e|rk|.

|"S|ignal |her!" |said |Phileas Fogg| quietly|.
|
|A small |br|a|ss| |cann|on |st|ood on |the |for|ward |d|eck| of |the |Tan|kadere|,
|for |ma|king |s|ignal|s in the |f|ogs|.  |It| was |load|ed to |the m|u|z|zle|;
|but |just as the p|ilot| w|as |about |to |a|pp|ly a |re|d-hot |co|al| t|o the |t|ouchho|le,
|Mr. Fogg| said|, "|Hoist| you|r fl|ag!"

|The |flag| w|as |ru|n |up| |at |h|alf-mast,| a|nd|, |th|is be|ing the |signal| of| |dis|t|ress,
|it was |hoped| that the |American |steamer|, |per|ceiv|ing it|, |would |chan|ge| h|er|
course a little|, |so |as to| s|uccou|r t|h|e |pil|ot|-boa|t.

|"Fi|re|!" said |Mr. Fogg|.|  |A|nd| th|e| bo|oming of the |l|ittle c|annon
|re|sounded i|n |the a|ir|.|

IN WHICH |PASSEPART|OUT| |FINDS O|UT |TH|AT, E|VEN |AT |TH|E |ANTI|PO|DES,|

|

|Th|e |C|arnatic|, |set|ting s|ail f|rom |Hong Kong| at half-past |six |on the|
|7th of |November, directed h|er |course |at |full steam| |to|wards |Ja|pan|.
|S|he |carri|ed a| larg|e c|ar|go| and a |well|-f|ille|d |c|a|bin| of |passengers.
|Two s|tate|-r|oom|s |in t|he r|ear| |were|, h|owever|, u|noccupi|ed--t|hose which|
|had |been |en|gaged| |by |Phileas Fogg|.

|The| |next day| |a passe|nger| w|ith |a ha|lf|-|st|upefied |eye, s|taggering |gait|,
|and d|isordere|d h|air|, |was |seen t|o |e|mer|ge from the |se|cond cabin,|
a|nd |to t|ott|er |to a s|ea|t on d|eck.|

|It was Passepartout|; and what |had |ha|ppened| to |h|im| |was |as |follows|:
|Sh|ortly |after |Fix| le|ft |th|e |opi|um| de|n, t|wo |wait|ers| ha|d |li|fte|d|
the |un|conscious |Passepartout|, |and| h|ad |ca|r|ried |him t|o |the |bed
re|se|r|ved| |for the| s|moke|rs|.  |Three |hours| |later|, |p|ur|su|ed |even|
in |his |dreams| b|y |a |fi|xe|d |idea|, |the po|or |fellow |awo|ke|,
a|nd |str|uggl|e|d |against |the |s|tupefying in|fluen|ce o|f the| |nar|cot|i|c|.
|The| |thou|ght| of |a |duty| |unf|ulfil|led sh|oo|k |off |hi|s |torpor,|
and |he hurr|ied from the abod|e of |dr|unken|ness|.
|St|aggering| a|nd |ho|lding |him|self |up |by |keeping a|gain|st the| |wa|lls|,
f|alling| down| a|nd |cr|e|ep|ing up again|, and |ir|resist|ibl|y i|mp|elled
|by |a |kin|d of ins|t|inct|, |he |kept c|r|ying out, "|The |Carnatic|! the| |Carnatic|!|"

|The| st|eam|er l|ay |p|uffi|ng| |alon|gs|ide| the |quay|, o|n the |poi|nt of |s|t|arting.
|Passepartout| |had |but f|ew s|teps t|o go|; a|nd, r|ushing upon |the p|la|nk,|
|h|e |cr|ossed |it|, |and |f|ell| |uncons|cious on| th|e |deck, |j|ust |as| |the| |Carnatic|
w|as |mo|v|ing |off|.  |Se|veral |sa|i|lor|s|, wh|o |were |evidently |accu|stomed|
to th|is |s|ort| of scen|e|, carri|ed |the |po|or| |Frenchman| down |into the| |second| |ca|bin|,
|and |Passepartout| |d|id not |wake |u|ntil the|y |were| on|e |h|undred |an|d |fifty miles|
away |f|rom |Ch|i|na|.  |Thus |he |found |himself| |the |next morning| |on |the| d|eck|
|of |the |Ca|rnatic|, and e|agerl|y |inha|ling| the| ex|hila|rating |s|ea|-bree|ze|.|
|The |pure a|ir |sob|ere|d hi|m|.  |He |b|eg|an| to |co|llect| h|i|s |s|ense|, |which h|e |found|
|a |difficult task|; |but| |at l|ast |he |re|called th|e event|s of the e|vening| before|,
Fix|'s re|velation|, |and |t|h|e op|ium-house|.

"It |is |evident|," said he| to |hi|mself|, "|that |I ha|ve |been |ab|ominabl|y| d|ru|nk!
|What |w|ill Mr. Fogg| s|ay|?  |At least I have |not |miss|ed| the |steamer|,|
|which is t|he most |imp|ortant |t|hing|.|"

|The|n|, as |Fix o|ccurred to him|: "As for |th|at |ras|cal, I |hope w|e
|ar|e |well| r|i|d o|f hi|m, and |t|hat| he |ha|s n|ot d|ared|, |as |h|e pr|oposed|,|
|to |f|ollow| u|s o|n |board |the |Carnatic|.  |A |detective| on the |trac|k|
|of |Mr. Fogg|, |acc|used |of| robb|ing |the| |Bank of |England|!  |Pshaw|!
Mr. Fogg |is |no| m|o|re a r|obber| |tha|n |I am a m|urderer|."

S|hould he |divulge| |Fix|'s real e|rrand| to hi|s master|?|  W|ould it|
do to tell| |the pa|rt th|e d|etective |was playing|.|  |Would |it |not| be|
|b|e|tter to| w|ait u|nt|il |Mr. Fogg| re|ached| |Lon|don| |again|, a|nd |the|n|
|impart to him| t|ha|t |an| ag|ent of |th|e |metropo|litan| po|lice| h|ad |been|
f|ollowing h|im |r|ound the world|, |and |h|a|ve a |good |l|augh| o|ver| i|t|?|
|No| doubt|; |at least, |it was w|or|th |con|si|dering|.  |The| first |thing t|o
do| w|as |to |fin|d |Mr. Fogg|, |and| apolo|gise| |for |hi|s s|ingular be|ha|viour.|
|
|P|assepartout| g|ot |up| and |pr|oceed|ed|, |as| |well as |he c|ould |with|
|th|e roll|ing| of |the s|t|eam|er|, to the a|f|ter-de|ck|.|  |He |sa|w |no| one|
|who re|sembl|ed |either his master| |or Aouda|.  "|Go|od|!"  |muttered |he|;
"|Aouda ha|s not |go|t u|p| y|e|t|, |and| |Mr. Fogg| ha|s probably| |fo|und some|
|par|tners| a|t |whi|st|.|"

|He des|cended to the s|aloon|.|  |Mr. Fogg |was |not |the|re.|
|Passepartout| had |only, however, |to a|sk the purser| the n|umber|
of h|is master|'s |s|tat|e|-r|oom|.  |The |p|urse|r| r|e|pl|ied| th|at| he|
|did not |kn|ow a|ny |passe|nger| |b|y the |n|ame of |F|o|gg.

|"I beg| you|r |pa|r|don|," |said |Passepartout| p|er|siste|nt|ly|.  |"|He is |a |tall g|entlem|an|,|
|qui|et, a|nd no|t v|ery |talkative|, |and |h|as |wi|th |hi|m |a young |lady-|-|"

"|Th|ere| is| no| young| |la|dy on board|," |interrupted the p|urser|.|
|"He|re| is a l|ist |of t|he p|assengers|; you| m|ay see| f|o|r you|r|self|."

|Passepartout| scanned the li|st|, |but| h|is |master|'s |name |w|as n|ot |u|pon |it|.
|A|ll |at once| a|n id|ea struck| |hi|m.|

|"A|h|! |am| I| on the |Carn|atic|?"

"|Yes|."

"On| the w|ay |to |Yokohama|?"

"|Certainly.|"

|Passepartout| |ha|d f|or| a|n |in|stant| fea|red that |he w|as on |the |wrong |boat;
but|, th|ough| |he |was |re|ally on |the |Carnatic|, |his |master| w|as |no|t |t|he|re|.
|
|He |fell| th|un|derstr|uck on |a |s|eat|.|  |He saw |i|t al|l no|w|.
|H|e rem|embered th|at |the t|ime| |of |sailing| had |been |c|hanged|,
|th|at |he should |have in|formed hi|s |m|aster| of |that |fact,|
and |that |he |had not |done so|.  |It |was his fault, |then,|
that |Mr. Fogg |a|nd |Aouda| had |m|issed| the| |st|eamer|.
|Yes, |but it was s|till| |more th|e f|a|ult| of the |tra|i|tor| w|ho|,|
in| order to |s|eparate hi|m from |hi|s |ma|ster|, and |de|tain
|the |l|a|tter| a|t |Hong Kong|, had inve|igled hi|m in|to g|ett|ing |drunk|!
He |no|w |sa|w th|e |de|tective|'s trick|; and| |at th|is| moment| |Mr. Fogg|

A|fter |his first |depress|ion|, |Passepartout| |be|came |ca|lm|e|r,

|He| |fell t|o |at| m|eals with| an a|ppetite|, |and| |a|te |for| |Mr. Fogg|, Aouda,

|Th|e |Frenchman f|elt |himself |as much a|lone a|mong the|m |as| if |he had d|ro|pped|

He |had|, a|t least, one |re|source to c|al|l |o|n the |French a|nd English| consuls|

"|Humph|!  |I t|hink so|," replied |P|assepartout|, |re|c|alling |the ex|er|cise|s

"|Well,| |th|at|'s |enough|," said |the |Honoura|ble |William |Ba|t|ulcar|.

|The |eng|age|ment was co|ncluded th|ere| a|nd the|n|.

"|Myself."

"|Very well|; then l|et us go |to the s|te|amer|, |young man|!"

|What happened |when the |pilot|-|boat| came in s|i|ght| |of |Shanghai| will
|b|e e|asily guessed.  |The| |sign|al|s |ma|de| by the| |Tankadere| h|ad |been|
|seen |b|y the c|aptain |of |the |Yokohama |steame|r|, who|, |e|spying the| f|l|ag
at half-|mast|, |ha|d di|rect|ed |his |course |to|wards the l|ittle |c|raft|.
|P|hileas Fogg|, |a|fter |paying |the| |st|ipulated p|ri|ce| of h|is |passage |to
|John B|u|sby|, |and |re|wa|rding th|at| w|or|thy wi|th the |addition|al |s|um of
|fi|ve |hundred |and |fift|y| pounds|, a|scend|ed |the| st|eamer| w|ith |Aouda|
|and F|ix; and| th|e|y |started| |at |once for |Naga|saki| a|nd |Yokohama|.

|The|y |rea|ched the|ir d|esti|nation| on the |morning| of the |1|4th| of November|.
|Phileas Fogg| |l|ost no time in |going |on| board the |Carnatic|, w|here |he |learned|,
t|o Aouda|'s gr|eat |deli|ght|--and |perhaps t|o hi|s o|wn|, t|hou|gh he |be|tray|ed|
no |emotion|--th|at |Passepartout|, a| French|man|, h|ad |re|al|ly |arr|ived |on |h|er|
th|e day |before|.

|The |Sa|n| Francisco |steamer| was |a|n|nounced t|o |leave |that v|ery| |eve|ning|,
|and |it became ne|cessary t|o |fi|nd |Passepartout|, i|f possibl|e|, |with|out| d|elay|.
|Mr. Fogg| a|pp|lied in v|ain |t|o the French |an|d |English| consul|s|, and|,
|a|fter w|andering th|rough th|e |st|reet|s| a lo|ng |ti|me|, |b|egan to |des|pair
of f|in|di|ng hi|s |mis|sin|g| se|rvant|.  |C|han|ce|, |or p|erhaps a k|ind| of |presen|timent|,
|at l|ast l|e|d h|im| in|to |the |Honourable Mr. Batulcar|'s t|heatre|.  |He c|ertainly|
w|ou|ld |not |have |re|cogn|ised |Passepartout| in |th|e |e|ccentr|ic mo|unt|e|b|ank|'s| c|ostume|;
but| the| l|atter|, lying on |his |b|ack|, |per|ceiv|ed h|is |m|aster| in |th|e |g|a|llery|.
|He c|ould not h|el|p |st|arting|, |whi|ch |so cha|nged the po|s|ition| of |his no|se|
a|s |to |bri|ng| |the| "pyra|mid|" |p|ell-mell| up|on th|e |st|age|.
|
|All |th|is |Passepartout| |l|ea|rned f|r|om |Aouda|, |who |re|co|unted t|o |hi|m|
|w|hat |had taken |pla|ce| |on |the |voyage| f|rom |Hong Kong| to |Shanghai|
|on t|he |Tankadere|, |in c|o|mp|any| w|ith| one Mr. F|ix|.

|P|ass|epartout| d|id not |change c|ou|nt|enance on hearing| th|is |na|me|.|
|He |thought| |th|at| th|e |time| had |not yet ar|rived to| |div|ulge |to |hi|s
|master w|hat| h|ad t|aken |pla|ce| |be|tween t|he de|tective| a|nd h|imself|;
|an|d|, |in |th|e account| h|e g|ave of hi|s |abs|en|ce, he |simply |ex|c|used |hi|mself
f|or |having |been |over|t|ake|n |by drun|ken|ness, |in| smoking| o|p|ium
a|t |a |tave|rn |in |Hong Kong|.
|
|Mr. Fogg| h|eard |this narrative |co|ldly, |without |a |word|; |and |th|e|n|
f|urnish|ed his ma|n with| |f|unds n|ecessary| |to |ob|tain| c|lothing| more|
in |h|ar|mony |w|ith |his |position|.|  |Within| a|n hour| the |French|m|an had|
c|ut off |his nose a|nd |pa|rted |with his w|ings|, and| |ret|a|ined n|o|t|hing
|about |hi|m| which re|c|all|ed the |s|ec|tar|y of the |god| Tingou.

|The |st|eamer w|hich |was a|bout to |depart| from |Yokoham|a to San Francisco|
|bel|onged |to th|e |Pacific| Mail Steams|hip |Co|mpany|, |and |w|as |n|amed
the General Grant|.|  |Sh|e |was a| |large| |paddle-|whee|l s|t|eamer|
|of t|wo thousand |five hundred| |to|ns|; well equi|p|ped |and |ve|ry |fa|st|.|
|Th|e ma|s|s|ive w|a|lk|ing|-b|eam| r|ose| an|d |fell a|bove the |d|eck|;|
a|t one |end |a |pi|ston|-rod wor|ked up| and down|;| |and |at the o|ther|
was |a co|nnect|ing|-ro|d |which|, |in ch|anging| the |rectiline|ar| motion
t|o a |circ|u|lar |on|e, |w|as |di|rect|ly |con|n|ected with| t|he s|h|aft| of| |the |p|addles.|
|Th|e |General Grant| was r|igged with |th|ree| |masts|, giving |a large |ca|pacity
for |sails, |and |thus |mate|rially| |aidi|ng |the |s|t|eam| power|.  |By |making
t|welve |miles| an hour|, |s|he |would |cross| the o|cean| in t|wenty|-one days.
|Phileas Fogg| |was |t|he|re|fore |justi|fied |in| ho|ping |th|at |he would |re|ach
|Sa|n Francisco| b|y the |2nd| of |December|, |New |York| by th|e |11th,|
|and |Lo|ndon| |on the |2|0th|--|thus |gainin|g s|everal hours| on |the |f|ata|l |da|te|
|o|f the| |21st of| December|.
|
|The|re| was a f|ull |c|om|pl|ement of |passengers| o|n |bo|ard|, |among the|m |Engl|ish,|
m|any |American|s, a| large number| of |co|olies| on the|ir way to |Califo|rnia|,
|and |se|veral |E|ast I|ndian offic|ers, who| w|ere |s|pending |th|eir| v|acation
|in |making |the |to|ur| of |the world|.  |N|othing| o|f moment| h|a|ppened| on| the |vo|yage|;
|the| st|e|ame|r|, |susta|ined o|n |its |large pa|ddles|, rol|l|ed but l|ittle|,|
and |th|e |Pa|cific a|lmost |j|usti|fied it|s n|ame|.  |Mr. Fogg| w|as| |as |calm|
and |ta|ci|turn a|s |ever|.  |His young| |co|mp|anion| fel|t h|erse|lf |more |and |more|
|a|t|tached |to |him| by |other |ti|es |th|an |g|ratitude|; |h|is s|ile|nt but |gener|ous| |nat|ure|
|impresse|d| her m|ore |than |s|he thought|; an|d i|t |was |almost u|n|co|nscious|ly |that|
|s|he |yi|elded |t|o e|motion|s |which| did not |seem to |have the| least |effect| upon|
her pro|tector|.  Aouda| |took |the| kee|nest i|nterest |in |his |plans|, and |be|came|
impatient |at a|ny |inc|ident w|hich |seemed like|ly| to |re|tar|d h|i|s |j|ourney.|
|
She often c|ha|tted with |Passepartout|, |who |did not |fail t|o |perceive|
the| |sta|te of th|e |lady|'s h|eart|; |and|, b|ein|g |the| mo|st |f|aithful of| |domesti|cs,|
|he |never e|xhausted| hi|s |eulogi|e|s| of |Phileas Fogg|'s| h|on|esty|, gen|erosi|ty|,
and de|votion|.|  |He |too|k |p|ain|s |to |calm |Aouda|'s |do|ub|ts| o|f a| successful|
|termina|tion of the |jo|urney|, |t|elling h|er that |the |mo|st d|ifficult| pa|rt|
of |it had |passed|, |th|at |now the|y |were |beyond |the| fa|ntastic| cou|nt|r|ies
o|f| |Japan a|nd China|, |and were |f|air|ly on the|ir |way to c|ivil|ised place|s again|.|
|A r|ailway tra|in| |from |San Francisco| to |New York|, |and |a| tra|nsat|la|nti|c s|teamer|
f|rom |New York| to |Liverpool|, |would |d|oubtless| bring| them| to |th|e |en|d of| th|is|
i|mpossible| |journey| r|ou|nd the wor|ld |with|in the |pe|riod| a|greed upon|.

|On th|e nin|th| day| a|fter |lea|ving |Yokohama, |Phileas| Fogg| h|ad |traversed| ex|actly|
o|ne half |of the |terr|e|stria|l |glo|be|.  |The| General Grant| passed|, on the |23rd|

d|iff|erence of |mer|idians|, he had re|ally g|one| over| t|wo|-|third|s o|f the|

|London |to Aden|, from |Aden t|o |Bombay|, fr|om Calcutta| to |Singapore|,
|and |f|rom |Singapore| to Yokohama|.|  |Co|uld he |have| |followed without|
d|eviation th|e f|iftieth parallel|, |which |is |th|at| of |London|,
|th|e |whole d|ist|an|ce| w|ould |only |have |been |abo|ut t|we|lve| |thou|sand |miles|;

|to tr|avers|e twenty|-si|x |thousand|, |o|f w|hich he |had|, |on| the |2|3rd| of |November|,|
acco|mp|lished s|eventeen thousand f|ive hundred|.  A|nd| |now |the |co|urse| was
a st|r|aight one, and |Fix was |no| longer| the|re| t|o put ob|stacle|s in| the|ir| w|ay|!

|It |ha|ppened| |al|so|, on the |23rd of |November|,| th|at P|assepartout|

|he |found that h|is w|atch| ex|act|ly |agreed with |t|he s|h|ip|'s |chr|on|ometers.|
|His t|riu|mph| |was |h|ilari|ous.  |He |would have l|i|ked to know| what| |Fix

|"Th|e |r|ogue |t|old |me| a |lot of| st|ories|," rep|eated| |Passepartout|,

|Passepartout| was |ign|orant |th|at|, i|f |the |face |of his |watch| had|
b|een |di|vi|ded in|to |twenty|-four hours|, li|ke| the |I|talian clock|s,|
|he would |have |no |re|a|son for exu|ltation; |for |th|e h|ands o|f |h|is wat|ch

|i|ndicate| nine o'clock| in the |evening|, |th|at is|,| |the |twenty|-|first |h|our
a|fter midnight| pr|ecise|ly the d|i|fference| |between |Lond|on |time| and th|at|
o|f |the |one hundred |and |eightieth mer|idian|.  |But| i|f |Fix| had |been |able
to |exp|lain| th|is p|ur|el|y |p|hysical |e|ff|ect, |Passepartout w|ould| no|t |have| admit|ted|,
|even if he had |comprehended| it.  |Mor|eover, i|f the |detective| had |been| |o|n board|
|at |th|at |mo|ment|, Passepartout| w|ould |have| joined |is|sue| with |hi|m |on| |a |qu|ite|
different s|ubject|, and |i|n a|n e|n|tire|ly different manner.|

|Wh|ere |wa|s |Fix| a|t that m|oment|?

He |was |a|ctually o|n |board| the |General |Grant|.

|On |rea|ch|ing |Yokohama|, |the |de|tective|, l|e|a|ving |Mr. Fogg|, |wh|o|m he ex|pected
|t|o |meet| again| d|uring the day|, had repair|ed |a|t once| |to |the |E|nglish| |co|nsulate|,|
w|he|re |he at |last fou|nd |the| w|arra|nt| of| arrest|.  |I|t |had |fo|llowed| hi|m| from |Bombay|,
|and |h|ad |co|me| by| t|h|e |Carnatic|, |o|n which| steamer| h|e |h|i|mself| w|as |su|pp|osed |to be.|
|Fix|'s d|isappointment| ma|y| be imagined| when |he re|flected| that th|e |warrant| was|
|no|w |usele|ss|.|  |M|r. Fogg |had |left |Engl|ish| |gr|ound|, |a|nd |it |w|as now| |n|ecessary
t|o |pr|oc|ure his ex|tra|dition|!

|"|Well," th|ought |Fi|x|, a|fter |a moment| of a|nger|, "my warrant |is no|t| good h|e|re|,

|five |thousand pounds|.  |Yet, |a|fter |all|, t|he |Ba|nk is r|ich|!|"

His c|o|urse de|cided |on, h|e we|nt on |board| t|he |General Grant|,
and |w|as |th|ere w|hen |Mr. Fogg a|nd |Aouda| arriv|ed|.  |T|o h|is utt|er|
a|ma|ze|ment|, |he |r|ecogn|ised |Passepartout|, |despite |his |theatri|cal disguise.|
|He qui|ckly co|nce|aled| hi|mself |in| his |cabin|, t|o avoid a|n| awkward| e|x|planation|,
and |hoped|--|thank|s| to the n|umber of pa|ssengers|--t|o| |re|main| un|perceived|
b|y |Mr. Fogg|'s |servant|.

|On that| very day|, |however, h|e |met| |Passepartout| face |to |f|ace|
|o|n the |for|ward| d|eck|.|  |The| lat|ter|, w|ith|out |a |word|,
|ma|d|e |a |rush for| him, |gr|asped him |b|y |the |th|r|oat,
|and|, |much |to |the a|musement of |a gro|up| of |American|s,|
who| |im|medi|ately |began| to |be|t |o|n him|, a|d|min|istered|
t|o |th|e| |detective| a per|fect |volley |of bl|ows,
|w|hich| |pr|o|ved |the g|reat |s|uper|ior|ity of |F|rench|
o|ver |Engl|ish| |pu|gili|stic |s|ki|ll|.

When |Passepartout| |had |fini|shed, |he |fou|nd |hi|mself |re|lie|ved|
|a|nd |c|omfort|ed|.  F|ix |got up |in| a so|mewhat| r|umpl|ed| c|on|dition,|
|and|, looking a|t |hi|s |adversar|y|, c|old|ly |said, "|Have y|ou |d|one|?"

"|For t|his t|ime|--yes."

"|The|n le|t me| ha|ve |a w|ord |with| you|."

"|But| I|--"

"|I|n you|r |master|'s interest|s."

Passepartout| s|eemed |to be |van|quished by |Fix|'s| |cool|ness|, |for |he |quietly
|fo|llowed him|, |and |they |sat down| as|ide| from the| |re|st of |the |pass|engers|.|
|
"|Y|ou have| given| me| |a |th|rashing|," |said |Fix|.  "|Good|, I| |e|xpect|ed| i|t.
|Now|, l|isten t|o me|.  |Up t|o this time| |I have |been Mr. Fogg's |a|dversary|.
|I am no|w| in |his |game|."
|
"|Aha!" |cried |Passepartout|; "|you |a|re |con|vi|nced| he is |a|n |honest| man|?"

|"No|,|" re|plied |Fix| co|ldly, "|I |think |him| |a ras|cal|.  |Sh! |don't |b|udge|,|
|and l|et |me |spe|ak|.  |As |long a|s |Mr. Fogg| was |on |English| ground|,

|Passepartout |l|istened|, |w|ith |cl|osed fists|.

|"Now|," |resume|d |Fix|, "|Mr. Fogg| seem|s to |be |going b|ack| t|o |England|.
|We|ll, I |will follow him| th|ere|.  |But he|re|after |I |w|ill |do| as |much|

t|hat you| |will |as|certain |wh|ether |you| are |in |the |serv|ice| of a c|riminal|

|Passepartout| |listened| v|ery |attenti|vely| to Fix|,|
a|nd| w|as |convi|nc|ed |that |he |spoke |with e|ntire good fa|ith.

|"|Ar|e we| |fr|iends|?" asked |the |detective|.

"|Fri|en|ds|?--no|," |re|plied |Passepartout|; "|but |all|ies|,| per|haps|.
|A|t the |l|east |s|ign| of |tr|eason|, |ho|wever|, |I'll t|wist your |n|ec|k| for you|."

|"|Agreed|," said |the detective| quiet|ly|.|

|El|eve|n |days l|ater|, on the |3rd of |December, the |General |Grant|
en|tere|d the bay of the |G|old|en |Ga|te|, and reached S|an Francisco|.|

IN WHICH |A |SLI|GH|T G|LI|M|PSE IS |HAD O|F |SAN |FR|AN|C|ISCO|


|It w|as s|eve|n in the morning| when Mr. Fogg|, |Aouda,| and Passepartout|
|se|t foot |upon the A|merican| |cont|inent,| i|f |th|is n|ame ca|n be| g|iven| to|
the f|loating| |qua|y upon wh|ich t|he|y |d|isemb|arked|.  |These |qu|ays,
r|ising and falling| with the |tide|, |th|us fa|cilit|at|e th|e l|oad|ing
|and u|n|lo|ading of ve|sse|ls|.  Alongside| t|he|m| w|ere| cl|ipp|ers |of a|ll |si|ze|s|,
s|te|amers |of |all nation|al|ities|, and |the |s|teamboats|, w|ith |several| decks
r|ising on|e |abo|ve the o|ther|, wh|i|ch pl|y |on| the |Sacramento| a|n|d |it|s t|ributaries|.
|Th|ere| w|ere |also h|eap|ed up t|he prod|ucts| of |a| c|omm|erce| w|hich| extend|s |to Mexico|,
Chi|li, |Peru|, |Braz|il|, |Europe|, |Asia|, and a|ll the |Pa|cific| is|lands|.

|Passepartout|, |in his |joy o|n r|ea|ching at |last the| |American c|ontinent|,|
|though|t he w|ould |man|if|est i|t by executi|ng a |pe|rilous |v|ault in |fin|e |style|;
|but|, |t|u|mbl|ing up|on |some |w|orm|-|eaten p|lanks|, |he |f|ell| th|rough the|m.
|P|ut out of |c|ount|enance b|y the manner| |in |which |he |th|us |"|set| foot"|
u|pon |th|e |New |World|, he |uttered a |l|oud cry, |wh|ich| so |frightened
|th|e| |inn|umerable |cor|mo|ran|ts |and p|e|l|ica|n|s that| are a|lways| |p|erched|
up|on the|se m|ova|ble| qua|ys|, |tha|t |the|y |flew n|ois|ily away|.

|Mr. Fogg|, |o|n |reaching s|hor|e, |p|r|oce|ed|ed |to |find o|ut| a|t w|hat h|our |the first
t|rain |left |for |New |York|, |and |l|ear|ned th|at| th|is |w|as at| s|i|x |o'clock| p.m.|;
h|e had|, there|fore|, an e|n|tire |d|ay to |sp|end in the |California|n ca|pital.
|Taking a c|arriage| at a ch|ar|ge| of |three d|ol|lar|s|, |h|e a|nd| Aouda| e|nt|ered| it|,
w|hile |Passepartout| |mounted |the bo|x be|side |the| d|river|, |and |th|ey| |set |o|ut|
for |the| International H|otel|.
|
|From |his |exalt|ed |p|o|sition| Passepartout| o|bserved |wi|th |much c|ur|ios|ity|
|the w|ide s|t|r|eet|s|, |the lo|w|, |eve|nly ra|nged |ho|u|ses|, |th|e| Anglo-|Sa|xon
|G|o|thi|c c|hurches, the g|reat |dock|s, the p|alati|al |woode|n |an|d |br|ic|k w|arehous|e|s,
|the n|umerous co|n|veyances, |omnibuses,| h|orse-cars|, |and |upon |t|he| |side-walks|,
no|t |o|nly |American|s| and |European|s|, |but C|hinese |and |Indian|s|.  |P|assepartout|
|was |s|ur|prised| |at a|ll h|e s|aw.  Sa|n Francisco |w|as no| longer |the le|gendar|y |city
|of |18|4|9--a c|ity of band|it|ti|, |as|sassin|s, and i|nc|endi|ari|es|, wh|o |h|ad |flo|cked|
hi|the|r in c|rowds| in| p|ursuit| of| p|l|under|; |a| p|ar|adise| of |o|utl|a|ws,| wh|ere |the|y|
|gamble|d w|ith g|old|-d|ust, |a r|ev|olver| in| one |h|and| and |a |bowie|-kni|fe| in the other|:
it was now |a g|reat |co|mme|rc|ial |emporium|.

|The |lo|fty |to|wer| of |it|s C|ity H|all| o|ver|loo|ke|d the |wh|o|le| p|a|norama|
of |the |st|reet|s| and a|venues|, |whi|ch| c|ut| e|ach |other| a|t right|-angles|,
|and |in| th|e |midst of which |app|eared| p|l|easant|, verda|nt square|s,|
w|hile beyond |appeared |the| C|hinese| |qu|arter, |seeming|ly i|mp|orted
|from |the| |Cele|stia|l Emp|ire| in| a toy-box.|  Som|br|eros and red shirts
and pl|umed |India|ns| were |r|arely |to be |se|en|; but| there| were| s|il|k h|at|s
|and bl|a|ck |coa|ts| e|very|where| wo|r|n by |a| mu|ltitude o|f |nervo|usly ac|ti|ve|,
gentlema|nly|-l|ooking m|e|n.  |Some of t|he st|r|eet|s|-- es|peci|ally |Montgomery Street,|
which is to |San Francisco| wh|at| |Rege|nt Street| is |to |Lon|don|,
the B|oulevard d|es Ital|ien|s| t|o |Paris|, and |Broa|dway| |to |New |York|--
|were| |li|ned |with s|ple|ndid |and |sp|acious |st|ores|,| which e|x|po|s|ed|
|i|n the|ir w|indows |th|e |produc|ts of |the en|tire w|or|ld|.|

|Whe|n |Passepartout |r|eached the| |International Hotel|,
|it d|id not seem t|o |h|im| |as |if he had |left |Engl|and| |at |all|.

|The| g|round flo|or of the |ho|tel |was occu|pied| by |a large| |b|ar|,
|a| sort of r|estaura|nt| fr|eely op|en to |all |pa|sser|s-by|, who| |might|
|p|artake| of d|r|ied |beef, o|yster| |s|ou|p|, biscuit|s, and |ch|ee|se,|
|w|ith|out |t|aking |out| the|ir |pu|rse|s.  |Payment |was |m|ade only |for t|he |a|le,
p|ort|er, or |s|he|rry which |was dr|unk. | Th|is s|eem|ed| "ve|ry |America|n"
to |Passepartout|. | The| h|otel re|freshme|nt-|rooms |were |comfor|tabl|e|,|
|and |Mr. Fogg| a|nd |Aouda|,| in|st|al|ling| the|mselves| a|t |a |t|able,|
|were |ab|und|ant|ly |s|erved |on |dimi|nutive| |p|late|s |by |n|egroes |of |d|arkest h|ue|.
|
|After |br|eakfast|, |Mr. Fogg|, a|cc|omp|anied by |Aouda, |sta|rt|ed for|
th|e E|nglish| co|nsul|ate| t|o |have |his |passport| |visaed|.  |A|s he |was|
go|ing |out|, |he |met Passepartout|, |who| |asked |him |if| |it w|ould| not| be| |well|,
b|efore |t|aking |the train|, |t|o pu|r|chase |s|ome d|ozen|s of |En|fi|eld |r|i|fles
a|nd Co|lt|'s r|evol|vers|.  |He |had| b|een l|isten|ing |t|o |s|tor|ies| of |attacks|
upon the| tr|ains| by the |Sioux| and Pawnee|s.|  |Mr. Fogg| |thought| it|
|a useless |preca|uti|on|, |but t|o|ld |hi|m to |do| |as he thought| b|e|st,
and w|ent on t|o |the |co|n|sulate.|
|
He had no|t p|r|oceeded two hundred st|eps|, ho|wever,| |w|hen,| "by the|
greates|t c|hance |in |the| wo|rld|," |he |met |Fi|x|.  |The| detective| |s|eemed|
w|ho|ll|y |taken |b|y |surprise|.  |What|!  |H|ad |Mr.| Fogg a|nd |hi|mself|
c|rossed |the| |Pacific |together, a|nd no|t |me|t |o|n the |steam|er|!
|At |l|east F|ix f|el|t honour|ed |to |be|hold |on|ce m|ore the g|en|tlem|an|
|to |whom |he owed s|o much|, and|, as |h|is b|u|siness re|called him to |Europe|,|
|he |sho|uld b|e |d|elight|ed t|o |c|on|tin|ue| t|he journey| |in |such |pl|easan|t |co|mpan|y|.
|
|Mr. |Fogg| rep|lied |th|at |the| |honour w|ould |be |his|; |and| t|he| |detective|--
who| was |dete|rmined| not to lose |si|ght| of him|--|be|gged p|ermission
|to |a|cc|ompany the|m| |in| the|ir |w|alk| about |San Francisco|--a r|e|qu|est
|which |Mr. Fogg |re|adily |gra|nt|ed|.

|The|y |s|oon| found the|mselves| in Montgomery Street|, wh|ere| |a| g|reat|
cr|owd| was c|oll|ected|; |the| side-wa|lks, |st|reet|, hor|secar| r|a|ils|,|
th|e s|hop|-doors|, the w|ind|ow|s of t|he| |ho|uses|, |and |eve|n the roo|fs|,
w|ere |f|ull of p|eople|.  M|en| w|ere g|oing| about c|arry|ing large| |post|ers|,
|and |f|l|ags |and |st|rea|mers| w|ere |floating| |in the| |wind|; |while| |lo|ud cr|ies|
|were hea|rd| o|n |every |hand|.

"|Hur|ra|h for |Ca|merfield|!"

|"Hurrah for |Mandi|boy!"

|It was| a |political| m|eeting|; |at least| so |F|ix co|n|jectured|, w|ho |said to| Mr.| F|ogg|,
"|Perhap|s| |w|e |had |better| no|t ming|le| with| th|e |crowd|.  |Th|e|re may| be| |danger| in |it."

"|Yes|," |re|turned |Mr. Fogg|; "and |blow|s|, e|ve|n i|f they| a|re p|olitical|
|ar|e |s|ti|ll |bl|ow|s.|"

|Fix| smile|d |at th|is r|emark|; a|nd, |in| o|rder| to |be |a|ble| to |see |without
|being |jostl|ed| about|, |the| |part|y |took| up a| position| on the| |top of a| f|li|ght
o|f s|t|eps s|ituated |at |the| upper |end of |Mo|ntgome|ry |Str|eet|.  |Opposite |the|m,|
o|n the |other |s|ide| of the |str|eet, |be|tween a |co|al |wha|rf| an|d a| pet|role|um warehouse,|
a| |l|arge |platform had |been| |e|rected| |in| t|he |open |air|, t|owa|rds |which th|e |current
of |the |cr|owd |seemed to |be |d|irected|.|

|F|or w|hat pu|rpos|e |was |this |meeting|?  |W|hat |was the |occasi|on of th|is|
|ex|cited a|s|s|embla|ge|?  |Phileas Fogg| |could |no|t |imagine|.  |Was |it t|o |no|mi|na|te
|so|me |h|i|gh o|ff|ic|ial|--|a| go|ver|nor| or m|em|ber o|f| C|ongress|?  |It was not |imp|ro|bable|,
s|o |ag|itat|ed w|as t|he |multitude |be|fore| t|he|m.|

|Ju|st a|t this moment| th|e|re| w|as a|n un|usual| |st|i|r |in |the |human m|a|ss|.
A|ll |th|e |hands were |r|ais|ed in |the |air|.  So|me|, |tightly c|l|osed|,|
|seem|ed to |disa|pp|ear s|uddenly in| |the |m|id|st| of |the |c|ries|--|a|n ene|r|getic wa|y,|
|no doubt|, o|f c|asting |a v|o|te.|  |The cr|owd| |swayed b|ack,| th|e |b|an|ners| and f|lags
|wa|vered, di|sa|ppear|ed| |an i|n|stant|, the|n |re|appeared| in t|atters.
|Th|e und|ul|at|ion|s |of the human |su|rg|e re|ach|ed the |st|e|ps|,|
w|hile |all |the |hea|d|s |fl|ou|nde|re|d o|n the |su|rface l|ike a |s|ea|
a|gitat|ed b|y |a s|quall.|  |Ma|ny o|f the |bla|ck ha|ts disa|ppeared|,|
and |the gr|eat|er part |of the |crowd| seemed| to |have| dimi|nished| |in |h|ei|ght.

|"It is evident|ly |a |m|eeting|,|" |said |Fix|, |"a|nd |its object| must be
|a|n |exc|it|ing |o|n|e|.  |I |sho|uld not w|o|nder |i|f |it w|ere a|bout t|he A|la|bama|,
des|p|ite the |fac|t that |th|at |question| |is |s|ettl|ed|."

|"|Perhaps|," |replied |Mr. Fogg|, |simply.|

"A|t least|, |the|re| are t|wo cha|mpion|s |in |pr|esen|ce| of e|ach other|,
|the |Honourable |Mr. |Camerfie|ld| a|nd| the |Ho|nourable| Mr. |Ma|ndiboy|."

Aouda, leaning upon |Mr. Fogg's |arm, o|bserved| th|e |t|um|ultuous s|ce|ne
|with| s|urprise, |whi|le |Fix |asked |a man| |ne|ar |hi|m| what| t|he| cau|se of it |all wa|s.|
|Be|fore |the m|an |c|ould |re|ply,| a |fr|esh| ag|itation a|rose|;| hurrahs| a|nd| e|x|cited
|s|ho|uts were heard|; |the| s|t|af|fs| o|f t|h|e b|a|nners |b|egan to |be |used
|as o|ffensive |wea|pons|; and |f|i|sts |fl|ew |about |in |every |direction.|
|Thumps |were |ex|changed| from the| |top|s of the c|a|rriage|s| and omnibus|es
wh|ich h|ad be|en |blocked up |in| the| crowd|.  |Bo|ots and s|hoes |we|nt |whirling
through |the| a|ir|, |and Mr. Fogg |th|ought| he e|ven h|eard| t|he |crack| |of r|e|volvers|
|mingl|ing |in the |di|n, th|e |rou|t a|pproach|ed| the| st|air|way|, and |flowe|d o|ver
|the l|ower s|tep.  |On|e of the p|art|ies h|ad |e|v|idently |been repuls|ed|;
but the |mere |lo|ok|ers-on cou|ld |not t|ell whe|ther| Mandi|boy| or Camerfield|
|h|ad |g|ained| |t|he |upper| hand|.|

"|It |would |be p|rudent for| u|s |to ret|ire,|" |said |Fix|, w|ho |was |a|nxious
t|hat |Mr. Fogg| |should not| |rec|eive| a|ny| |in|jury|, a|t least| un|til|
|t|he|y |got back |t|o |L|ondon|.  |"I|f th|e|re| is |a|ny |question a|bout| E|ngland|
in |all this|, and| we| |were |re|cognised|, |I fear i|t w|ould go hard| with| u|s."

"|A|n |English su|bject|--" |began Mr. Fogg|.

|H|e did not f|inish| |hi|s |se|nte|nce|; |for| |a |ter|ri|f|i|c h|ubbub now a|ro|se|
o|n th|e |t|er|ra|ce be|hind| the| fl|ight| of |st|eps w|he|re |the|y |st|oo|d|,

|It |was |a |b|and| o|f vo|t|ers |co|ming to |the rescue| of the|ir |alli|es|,
|and |taking |the |C|amerfield |force|s |in flan|k.  Mr. Fogg|, Aouda,|
a|nd |Fix found th|e|mselves| b|e|tween |two fires; i|t was t|oo late| to| es|c|ape|.
|The |to|rr|ent of |men|, a|rm|ed |with |loaded c|an|es and |s|ticks,| w|as |irres|istibl|e.
|Phileas Fogg| |and |Fix w|ere |r|ou|ghly |h|ustl|ed |in the|ir |at|tempt|s |to p|ro|tect
t|heir |fair co|mpanion|; the former|, |as |cool| a|s ever|, t|ried t|o |defend| hi|mself
w|ith the |weapons w|hich |nat|ure ha|s |pla|ced a|t the |end of| |every |English|m|an's |a|rm,
|but in |vain|.|  A| b|ig| |bra|w|ny |f|ellow| with |a re|d b|ea|rd|, |flushed| f|a|ce|,
and |b|ro|ad s|h|oulders, |wh|o |s|eemed |to |be |th|e ch|ief| o|f the |band|,|
|r|a|ised hi|s |cl|en|c|hed fist |to s|tr|ike Mr. Fogg|, |wh|o|m |h|e |w|ould |have| |g|iven|
|a cr|ush|ing| |bl|ow|, h|ad |not |F|ix |ru|sh|ed in |an|d rec|eived| |it| |in |his |stead.
|An e|normous b|ruise| imme|diately |made i|ts a|ppear|ance| u|nder th|e |detective|'s|
|si|l|k h|at, w|hi|ch| |was |com|pletely |sm|as|hed in.

|"|Y|an|kee|!" |exclaimed| |Mr. Fogg|,| darting |a c|on|te|mptuous l|ook| at th|e |ru|ffian|.

|"|Englishm|an|!" |re|turned |the o|ther|.  "|We will meet a|gain|!"

|"|Whe|n you pl|ease."

|"What is you|r name|?"

"|Phileas| Fogg|. | And your|s?"

"|Colonel |Stamp| Proctor|."

|The| h|uman tide| now| swept |by, |after |o|verturning F|ix|, wh|o |speedily|
|g|o|t up|on |hi|s |feet| again|, |though |w|ith t|atter|ed| cl|oth|es|.  |Ha|ppily,
h|e was |not |s|eri|ous|ly |hur|t|.  |His t|r|avelling o|ver|coat| was |d|ivid|ed|
in|to |tw|o un|e|qu|al p|ar|ts|, and |his |trouse|rs| r|esembl|ed th|ose of| certain| Indian|s,
which |f|i|t les|s |comp|actly t|han the|y |are| e|as|y to| p|ut on|.
|Aouda |had |es|caped unharmed|, and |Fi|x |alone| b|ore| marks|
of |the |fr|a|y in his |black and bl|u|e |br|ui|s|e.
|
|"Th|a|nks|," said |Mr. Fogg| to th|e |detective|,
|as soon |as |the|y were out of t|he |c|rowd.|

"|No tha|nk|s| are |necessary," replied.|  |Fix|; "|but |let us |go|."
|
"|Wh|ere|?"

"|T|o |a ta|ilor's."

|Such a |visi|t wa|s|, indeed|, oppor|tune|.  |The |c|lo|th|ing |of |both |Mr. Fogg
a|nd |Fix was |in r|ag|s|, |as if |t|hey had th|emsel|ves been| a|ctively |engaged
in |th|e |con|test| be|tween |Camerfield an|d |Mandi|boy|.  |An |hour| after|,
th|e|y were on|ce |mor|e |suitabl|y |att|ired|, and |w|ith |Aouda| re|turned|
to |the |Internation|al Hotel|.

|Passepartout| |was |wa|iting| f|or |his |master|, armed |with |half |a do|zen|
si|x-barrelled| r|evol|ver|s|.  |Wh|en |he perceived| F|ix|, he |knit h|is |br|ows|;
but |Aouda |ha|ving|, |in a f|ew |wo|rds|, |t|o|ld |hi|m of |the|ir| a|dventure|,
|h|is |co|u|nte|nance| r|e|sumed |its |plac|id| e|x|p|ression|.  |Fix| ev|iden|tly|
|was no longer| |an| en|emy|, bu|t| |an a|lly; he was |fai|thful|ly |keeping |his w|ord.
|
|Dinner| o|ver|, |th|e |co|ach which |was to |co|n|ve|y |the| pa|ss|engers| and |the|ir |lu|gga|ge|
to th|e |st|ation| dr|e|w up |to th|e |door|.|  A|s he |was |getting in|, |Mr. |Fogg
|said| |to |Fix, "|You |have |no|t |s|e|en |th|is Colonel Proctor| |again|?"

"|No|."

"|I will |co|me |back t|o |Am|erica to find |him|," said |P|hileas Fogg| c|almly|.
|"I|t w|ould not |be |r|ight| for |an English|man| t|o |p|ermit| hims|elf| |to be |tr|eated
in| th|at w|ay|, w|ith|out |re|ta|liating.|"

|The |detectiv|e| smiled, but |did not |reply|.  |It |was clea|r that| |Mr. |Fogg|
w|as |on|e of th|ose |English|men| wh|o, wh|ile| the|y d|o no|t tolerate |du|el|li|ng| at |home|,
|f|ight| a|br|oad |w|he|n the|ir |honour |is |a|tt|ac|ked|.

At |a quar|ter before |s|ix| |th|e |travell|ers |rea|ched the |sta|tion|,
and |fo|und |the t|ra|in |rea|dy to d|e|part|.  |As |he |was a|bo|ut to |ent|er| i|t,
|Mr. Fogg ca|lled |a p|o|rter|, and |said| to| |h|im|: "|My |friend|,
w|as |th|ere |no|t |some t|rouble| to|-day| in |Sa|n Francisco|?"

"It was| a p|olitical mee|ting|, |sir," |replied |the |porter|.

"|But| I th|ought| th|ere| was a |great deal of |dist|urb|ance| in| th|e |s|treet|s.|"

|"|It w|as |on|ly a m|eeting| a|s|sembl|ed| for |a|n |el|ection|.|"

|"Th|e e|lection of |a g|en|eral|-in|-chi|ef|, |no| doubt|?" asked |Mr. Fogg|.

"|No|, sir|; of| a justice| of |the |pe|ace."

|Phileas Fogg| |go|t |into th|e |tra|in|, which |s|ta|rt|ed| |off |a|t |f|ull |speed|.

|himself fi|xed t|h|e| en|d of the |line| at |Omaha|, in |Nebrask|a|.  |The| |work| |was|
|at once |comm|en|ced|, and |pu|rsued |with t|rue |American| |en|ergy; |nor |did th|e|
ra|pidit|y w|ith| |w|hich |it we|nt on in|jurious|ly affect| |it|s |g|ood e|xecution|.
|The road| grew, on the p|r|airies|, a mil|e |a|nd a |half| a |day|.  |A l|o|comotive|,|

t|o |be |laid |on th|e |mor|row|, and| |advanced| u|p|on the|m |as |fast| as |the|y |were|
|p|ut |in pos|iti|on|.|

|The |Pacific Ra|ilroad |is| joined by s|e|veral |br|anch|es |in |Iowa|, |Kansas,
|Col|o|rado|, and |Ore|gon|.  |O|n |leaving |Omaha|, |it |passes alon|g the| |l|e|ft| b|ank|

o|ne hundred |and |twe|lve| feet to t|he| mile.|

|Such w|as |the |road| t|o |be |tra|versed in |seven days|, |w|hich |would| e|nab|le
|Phileas Fogg--|at least|, |s|o |he |hoped--to tak|e |the A|tlantic |steamer|
|a|t |New York| on |the |11th| for |Liverpool|.

|The c|ar| w|hich h|e |occ|u|pied |w|as |a s|ort of |l|ong o|mni|bu|s on ei|ght| w|heels|,

of |a|n a|i|sle| w|hich c|o|nducted| t|o |the |f|ro|nt| a|nd rear| pla|tform|s|.
|The|se platform|s |were |f|ound |thr|ough|out| the |train|, and |the |pa|ssenger|s
were |able to |pass| |from one end o|f the |train to the other|.
|It |w|as s|up|pl|ied with |sa|loo|n cars|, |ba|lcony| car|s, r|e|st|aurant|s,|
and s|mok|ing|-cars|; th|eatre |ca|rs a|lone |were |wanting, and |the|y |will
h|ave |th|e|se |some day|.|

|Book |an|d news |de|aler|s|, s|el|le|rs of |e|di|bles, |drink|able|s, and |ci|gars,
wh|o |s|eemed |to |have |pl|ent|y o|f |c|ustomers|, |we|re |co|nt|inu|ally c|ircu|lat|ing
in| |the |ai|sle|s.|

|Th|e tra|in |left Oakla|nd st|ation| at |six o'clock|.  |It was |already| n|ight,|
c|old a|nd |cheer|less|, t|he| heavens |being overc|ast| |with clo|uds| which| |seemed|
|to |threate|n s|now|.  The| train| |did not |pro|ceed| r|apid|ly|; |c|ou|nt|ing the sto|ppages|,
it did not |r|un m|ore |th|an t|wenty| mi|les |an hour|, |whi|ch |w|as |a s|uff|ici|ent |speed|,

|The|re| was b|ut l|ittle |conve|rsation| |in| |the |car|, and |so|on |many o|f |th|e |pass|engers|
|were |o|vercome with| |sleep.  P|assepartout| found himself| |be|side |the |detective|;
|but| he |di|d not| t|alk |to |him|.  |A|fter |rece|nt event|s|, the|ir re|lat|i|on|s |with| e|ach|

re|served|, |and |re|ady to |st|rangl|e |hi|s former |fr|iend o|n |the |sl|igh|test| pro|v|ocat|ion.

|Snow began |to |fa|ll |an| hour |a|fter the|y |started|, |a f|ine| snow, h|owever,|
|whi|ch| happ|ily |c|ould |not |ob|st|ruct |the |t|rain; |nothing could |be| |see|n
f|rom |the |windows |b|ut a| |vast|, |whi|te |sheet, a|ga|inst |which |the| s|moke
|of |th|e |lo|comotive| had |a |gre|yish |a|s|pe|ct|.|

|A|t eight o'clock |a s|teward |enter|ed| |the |car| a|nd |a|n|nounced| that|
the| t|ime |for |going to |be|d ha|d |a|rriv|ed; and i|n |a few| minutes|
th|e |car w|as |transf|ormed into a| d|ormito|ry.|  |Th|e b|ac|ks| of the| |sea|ts
were |thrown b|ack|, |b|edst|ead|s c|arefully |p|acked| |were| |rolled out |b|y

|I|t |only re|main|ed| |to |go t|o |bed |and |sl|eep| |which |every|body |di|d--|
|wh|il|e t|he |train| s|ped on a|cro|ss the |State of |Ca|lifornia|.

|The |country| between |S|an |Francisco| and |Sacramento| is no|t |v|ery |h|illy.
|The| C|entral |Pacific|, |taking |Sacramento| for it|s |st|arting-p|oint|,
|extend|s eastward| to |meet |the road| f|rom |Omaha|.  |The| line f|rom |San Francisco|
to |Sa|cramento| |run|s| |in a |north-e|ast|erly| direction, al|ong| the |American| R|iver|,
|wh|ich |empti|es |in|to |Sa|n P|ab|lo Bay|.  T|he| o|ne hundred and |twenty| mi|les| |be|tween|
the|se c|iti|es| were |a|ccompl|ished| in |si|x |hours|, and t|o|wards |midnight|, |while
fa|s|t as|leep|, the| |tra|velle|rs| |pas|s|ed| through| |Sacramento|;| s|o th|at the|y |s|aw |nothing|
o|f that i|mpo|rtant |place|, t|he |seat| o|f t|he |Stat|e |government|, w|ith its| |fine| |qu|ays|,
|i|t|s |br|oad s|tre|ets|, |i|ts |nobl|e ho|tels, s|quares, a|nd c|hurch|es|.

|The |tra|in|, on leaving |Sacramento|, a|nd passing the |junct|ion|, |Ro|c|li|n|,| A|ubu|rn|,
a|nd C|olfax, enter|ed t|he ra|nge |of |th|e |Si|erra Nevada|.  |'Cisco w|as reached
a|t seven in the morning|; and| an| |ho|ur| |late|r the d|ormitory |was |transf|ormed|
in|to |an o|rd|in|ary |c|ar|, and |the |tra|vel|lers |could o|b|serve| th|e |pict|ures|que|
beauties |of the| mountain| regi|on| t|hrough| w|hich |they| were| |ste|aming|.|
The| rail|way |t|ra|ck |w|ou|nd |in |a|n|d |o|ut| a|mong the| |p|asse|s, |n|ow ap|pr|oaching
the| m|o|untain|-si|des, |now |su|spe|nded| o|ver |prec|ipi|ces|, av|oid|ing |abrupt a|ngles|
by |bold |c|urve|s, pl|ung|ing i|nto |narrow |defi|les|, |whi|ch seem|ed |t|o |have|

|with| |its |s|harp| bel|l|, and |i|ts |co|w-catcher| exte|nded| like |a |spur,|
|mingled it|s |shr|ie|ks and b|ello|wings| with |the| n|oise| o|f t|or|rent|s| and |ca|sca|des,
|a|nd |tw|ined it|s |sm|oke |a|mong the |branches| of |the |gigantic |p|in|es|.|

|The|re| were |f|ew or no br|idges| o|r |tu|nne|ls| on the |ro|ute|.  |The| railway|
turn|ed |around |the |s|ides| of the |mountain|s|,| and |did not at|tempt to |viola|t|e
|nature| by t|ak|ing |the |shortest |cut| from one |poi|nt t|o |another.|

|The train entered the |St|ate of |Ne|vada |t|hr|ough the |Car|son |Valley
|about |nine o'clock|, |going always| nort|he|asterly|; a|nd a|t m|idd|ay re|ached |Reno,
w|h|ere the|re w|as a delay o|f twenty |minutes |for b|rea|kfast|.|

|From th|is |point |the road|, |ru|n|ning |along| |Humbold|t |River|,
|p|assed northward |for s|everal |mi|les| by |it|s banks|; then |it|
|turned e|ast|ward|, |and |kept by the| river |u|nti|l it |rea|ch|ed|
t|he |Humboldt |Range|, |nearly at |the extreme |eastern limit of |Nevada.|
|
|Having |breakfasted|, |Mr. Fogg| a|nd |his companion|s| r|es|umed| their |place|s|
i|n |the c|ar|, and |observ|ed th|e |vari|ed |landscape |which unfold|ed |itself
|a|s |they |pass|ed |al|ong| the |vast pr|airies|, |th|e |mountain|s lining t|he| ho|rizon|,
and |t|he| cr|eeks|, |with |the|ir f|rothy|,| fo|ami|ng s|tr|eams|.  |Some|times| a| great| h|erd
|of |buffaloes|, |ma|ssing together| in |the |d|ist|ance|, s|e|emed like |a |m|oveable |da|m.
|Th|e|se innu|merable m|ultitude|s of r|um|inat|ing b|east|s often| form an|
i|n|s|u|rmountabl|e |obstacle| to |the |pass|age| |of |th|e |tra|in|s; |th|ousands|
of t|he|m ha|ve |been |see|n p|as|s|ing over| th|e |trac|k for |ho|urs| |to|gether,
in |co|mpact |ra|nks|.  |The| loco|motive| i|s |th|e|n |forced to |stop| an|d w|ait
|t|ill the r|oad| i|s |once m|ore |clea|r.|

|Th|is h|a|ppened|, indeed, |t|o |the |tra|in |in |which |Mr. Fogg |was |tra|ve|lling|.
|Abo|ut twelve o|'clock| a| t|roop of |ten or| twe|lve| th|ousand |head |of| b|u|ff|alo
e|nc|umbered| th|e tra|ck.|  |The| l|ocomotive|, s|lac|kening| i|ts sp|eed|, |tried to |cl|ear|
|th|e |wa|y w|ith i|ts c|ow-c|atche|r; |but the |ma|ss of an|imal|s w|as t|oo g|rea|t.
The buffaloes |ma|r|che|d along |with a| t|ran|quil g|ait, uttering now| |an|d then|
de|afening bellowings|.  |Th|ere| w|as |no| use| of |in|t|errupt|ing| them|, f|o|r,
|ha|ving t|aken a |par|ticul|ar |di|rection|, |no|thing c|an moderate| and c|ha|nge|
|the|ir |co|urse|; |it |is |a t|orrent |o|f living flesh| whi|ch |no d|am c|o|uld| co|ntain.|

|The |tra|vellers| |g|azed o|n th|is c|urio|us| s|pectacle |from |the |pla|tform|s;
|but |Phileas Fogg|, w|ho| had |the| most |reason| o|f a|ll| t|o b|e |in |a hurry,|
|remained in his |seat|, and |wa|ited philosoph|ically| until it sh|ould |please|
t|he b|uffaloes |to| g|et| |o|ut| of th|e w|ay.|
|
|Passepartout| w|as |furious| a|t the d|elay| th|e|y |occ|a|sioned, |and| lo|ng|e|d
t|o |d|i|sc|h|arg|e |hi|s arsenal of re|volvers| upon| the|m.

"|What a| |cou|ntry|!"| |cried |he|.|  |"|Mere| c|attle s|top| th|e trains|, |and g|o by
in |a |pro|ce|ssion|, |just as |if |the|y were| |no|t |im|p|e|di|ng| tra|vel|!  |P|arbleu|!
|I |sh|ould |li|ke t|o know |i|f |Mr. |Fogg| fore|sa|w t|his m|is|hap |i|n his |p|rogra|mm|e|!
|And he|re|'s |a|n en|gineer| w|ho d|oes|n't |d|are t|o run| t|h|e l|ocomotive|
i|nto |th|is h|erd |of |beast|s!"|

|The engineer| d|id not |try to |overcome t|he |obst|acle|, |and h|e was| |wi|se|.
|He w|ould |have |crus|hed |th|e |first| buffaloes|, no| |doubt|, |w|ith |the |co|w-cat|che|r;|
|but| the |l|ocomotive|, |h|owever| p|owerful|, w|ould soon| have |been| |checked,
the| t|rain| |would |inevitabl|y have |been |thrown |off |the |tra|ck|,
and w|ould the|n |have |been h|el|pless.|

|The| best cou|rse| was| |to| wait| |pa|tiently|, |and| rega|in| the| l|ost |time|
b|y |gr|eat|er |spe|ed w|hen |the |obst|acle| w|as |re|mov|ed|.  |The p|ro|ce|ssion|

|During |the nig|ht |of the |5th of |December|, |the |train| |ran |so|uth|-east|erly|

|Passepartout|, |a|b|out |n|ine o'clock|, |w|ent |out| upon |the |pla|tf|orm| to t|ake the |air|.
|The w|eather was c|old|, |the |heavens| grey|, |bu|t |it was |no|t s|no|wing|.|
|The s|un|'s |dis|c, |enla|rged b|y the |mi|st|,| se|emed a|n enormous r|ing o|f gold,|

|by |a| s|tr|an|ge|-look|ing per|sonage w|ho| made| hi|s appearance| on |th|e p|latform|.

|Th|is p|erson|age|, who had |t|aken |the| t|rain| a|t| El|ko|, |was t|all an|d d|ark|,

and |aff|ixed to th|e door| of e|ach c|ar| a notice| wr|itte|n| in ma|nus|cript|.
|
|P|assepartout| a|pproach|ed |a|nd |re|ad o|ne o|f the|se |notices, |which |stated that
Elde|r |William Hitch|, |Mo|rmon| mi|ssionary|, t|aking adv|antage| of his |p|r|esence|

"|I'll |go|," said |Passepartout| to himself|.|  He |knew n|ot|hing|
of| |Mormonism| exc|ept th|e custom| of pol|ygamy|, which is |its fo|un|d|at|ion|.

|The| ne|ws |quic|kly s|p|read th|rough the |train|, |wh|ich co|ntained|

|At th|e a|pp|oi|nted hour| Elder Wi|llia|m |Hit|ch| r|ose, |and|, |in |a|n i|rr|itated voice|,
a|s |if he had |already been c|on|trad|icted|, said, |"|I t|ell you |that |Joe| Sm|ith

Th|e|n, |e|mphas|ising hi|s |word|s| |with |his |loud| voice a|nd |fr|equent| |ge|stur|es|,

|But |th|is |di|d not |disc|oncert t|he e|nthusiast|, |who| |p|ro|ceed|ed| with|

|Passepartout| wa|s |no|w |th|e| |only p|erson le|ft i|n th|e |car|, |and th|e |Elder|,

|"|A|nd th|is," added |Elder William Hitch|, "thi|s is why| the |jealousy| of |Cong|ress

|During th|e |lecture th|e t|rain| had |be|en |making |good pr|og|ress|,
a|nd t|owards half|-past| twelve| i|t| reached| t|he |north|w|est border
o|f t|he |G|reat Salt Lake|.|  |The|nce t|he| passengers| could observ|e
|th|e |vast e|xte|nt of |th|is interior |sea, |w|hich |is |a|lso| |call|ed |th|e |Dead S|ea,
and i|n|to |which |f|low|s |an| Americ|an |Jorda|n.|  |It |is a| |pi|c|ture|sque expanse|,

|The |country |around the |lake |w|as |w|ell| c|ul|tivated, |for the| Mormon|s|
are |most|ly f|armers; wh|ile r|a|n|ches a|nd |pens| f|or| domestic|ated |a|nimal|s|,

|was |covered |with |a |thi|n powder|ing of |snow|.
|
|The |train |rea|ched |Ogden at t|wo o'clock|, where |it re|st|ed| for| s|ix |hours|,
|Mr. Fogg |a|nd |hi|s p|art|y |had| time to |pay| |a |visi|t t|o |Sa|l|t |Lake |City,
|co|n|nect|ed with |Ogden| |by |a |branch| roa|d|; |and they |spe|nt tw|o ho|urs|

of| th|e |Uni|on|, |li|ke a check|er|-b|oard, "w|ith| the |so|mbre |sadness| of| |r|i|ght|-angles|,"
as |Victor Hugo |expresses |i|t.|  |The founder of the| C|ity o|f |the| Sa|int|s
could not |escape| from |the t|aste |for |symmet|ry |wh|i|ch |d|is|tinguishe|s|
|th|e A|ngl|o-|Saxon|s|.  |I|n this strange| c|ount|ry|, wh|ere |the| |p|eople|

|eve|ry|thing| is do|ne |"|squarel|y"-|-c|iti|es|, h|ouses|, |and follies.|
|
|The |tra|vellers|, |then|, were pr|omenading, |at three o'clock|,
|a|bout th|e| s|tr|eet|s of |the |town| built bet|ween |the| bank|s| of the|

|A |cl|ay a|nd p|e|b|ble wa|ll, built in| 18|53, sur|round|ed |the| town|;|
and i|n th|e pr|i|ncipal |st|ree|t |were |t|he ma|rk|et and |se|ve|ral |ho|tels|
|ad|o|rn|e|d with |pa|v|ili|ons.  |The |place did not |seem thickly p|opulat|ed.
|The| s|t|r|eet|s were a|lmost deserted|, |ex|cept| |in t|he |vici|ni|ty| of th|e |t|emple|,
|which |the|y |o|nly re|ached |after| h|aving |traversed |several quarters|
s|urround|ed by pal|isades|.  There were |many wo|men|, w|hich |was easi|ly|
a|cc|ounted f|or |by the| |"peculiar in|st|itution" of the |Mo|rmons|;|
but |it |must |not be supposed that |all th|e| |Mormon|s a|re |poly|gami|sts|.
|Th|e|y are fr|ee |to marry| or no|t|, |as |th|ey |pl|ease|; but| it |is |wor|th |no|ting
that |it is |ma|in|ly th|e f|ema|le |citize|ns of |Utah| who are a|nxious| to| marry|,
|a|s|, according to the| Mormon| r|eligion|, |ma|iden |l|adies a|re |not| |adm|itted
t|o the p|ossession| of it|s highest jo|ys|.  |Th|ese |poor cre|atu|re|s seem|ed

that th|e fair |on|es of |Sa|lt Lake |City| |cast| ra|ther al|a|rming |g|lanc|es

w|ho| utt|ere|d the c|ries |was e|vidently |a bel|at|ed| Mormon|.  |H|e was|

p|latform| of the |train|, |and |fel|l|, |e|xhausted|, |i|nto o|ne |of the| |sea|ts|.

|Pa|ssepartout|, w|ho had |been |a|nxious|ly| wa|tching| th|is amateur |gym|nast,

|When |the |Mormon had re|covered |his |br|eat|h, Passepartout| v|entured

|The |tra|ck |up |to |this t|ime| |had |reached its highest| e|le|vat|ion| at|

t|o c|ro|ss |Muddy C|reek|, |Gr|een| C|ree|k, and others|, upon| cu|lv|er|ts|.

|Passepartout| g|rew |mo|re |an|d |more| |impatient |as |the|y |we|nt |on|,|

|A|t |ten o'clock| |at |night| the| |tra|in |s|topped| at |Fort |B|r|idg|e|r sta|tion|,
|and |twenty| minutes |lat|er| e|ntered| Wyoming Te|rritory|, |fo|llow|ing| the|

|the|y |stop|ped| for |a |quarter| o|f |an |hour| a|t |Gre|en| R|iver| s|ta|tion|.
|Snow |had |fallen| a|bundantly during |the |night|, b|ut, |being mixed| with |ra|in|,
it| had |half m|elted|, and d|i|d not |interrupt t|he|ir pro|gress|.|  |The b|a|d w|eather,
|however|, a|nno|yed |Passepartout|; for| |the |accu|mulati|on of s|now|,| by |blocking
the| wh|eels| |of |the| c|ars|, |would |ce|rtainly| have |been| |fatal |to |Mr. Fogg|'s| t|our|.

|"What| a|n| idea|!" |he said| |to |him|self|.  |"|Wh|y did |my |ma|ster| make|
t|his journey |in wi|nt|er?|  |Couldn't |he |have waited| for |the g|o|od

|Wh|ile the |w|or|thy |Frenchm|an |was |ab|sorbed in th|e |stat|e of th|e |s|ky

|S|everal p|asse|nger|s| h|ad |g|ot o|ff |at |Gre|en| River|, and w|ere |w|alking |up |and down|

|th|e sa|me w|h|o |had so g|ross|ly |in|sulted| |Phileas Fogg| a|t| the |San Franci|sco meetin|g|.
|No|t w|ishing to |be |re|co|gnised|, |the |young woman| dre|w |back |from the w|ind|ow|,
feeling |much a|la|rm a|t |he|r |disc|overy|.  |She w|as at|tac|he|d to the |man |who|,
h|owever coldly, gave |he|r |d|aily e|vidence|s| o|f th|e |mo|st |absolute| d|evotion.
|S|he |di|d not |compre|hend|, |perhaps|, |the |depth| of the |s|entim|ent with| |whi|ch
|her |protector| |insp|ired| |h|er, w|hi|ch| s|he |called gr|atitude|, |but| |which|,
|though| she w|as |unco|nscious |o|f |it|, |was |r|eally m|ore| than |th|at|.
|He|r |heart |sa|nk| within |h|er| |when she re|co|gn|ised| the| |ma|n whom|
|Mr. Fogg| d|e|sire|d|, soon|er| or |l|ater|, |t|o |call |to |a|cco|unt |for his co|nduct|.
|Chanc|e al|on|e, it |was |clear|, h|ad brought |Colonel |Proctor| |on |th|is tr|ain|;|
but |the|re |he w|as|, |and |it |w|as |n|ecessary|, a|t |all |haz|ards, |that |Phileas Fogg|
s|hould not p|er|ceive his adversar|y|.|

|Aouda| se|ized a| mo|ment| when Mr. Fogg |was |a|s|le|ep to t|ell |Fix |a|nd |Passepartout|
|w|ho|m |she |had |seen|.

|"Th|at |Proctor| on th|is tr|ain|!|" cried |Fix|.  "|Well|, re|assure| yours|elf,
|ma|dam|; b|e|fore |he se|tt|les with Mr. Fogg|; h|e has| got |to d|e|al |with| me|!
|It see|ms |to |me| th|at I was th|e |m|ore |insul|ted| of |the |t|wo|."

|"A|nd|, |be|sides," added |Passepartout|, |"I|'ll |take c|harge| of hi|m,|
|colonel| as he is|."

"|Mr. F|ix|,|" |re|sumed |Aouda|, "|Mr. Fogg| will al|low no| one| |to avenge |hi|m.|
|He |said |that |he would |com|e |back| t|o A|merica| to f|ind |th|is| man|.
|Sh|ould |he pe|rceive| |Colonel |Proctor|, w|e could not |pr|event |a co|l|lision|

|"|You a|re |r|ight|, madam|," replied| |Fix|; "a| meeting |be|tween |th|e|m
might |ruin a|ll.  W|he|ther he |we|re |v|i|ctorious |o|r b|ea|te|n, Mr. Fogg|
|w|ould |be |d|elayed|, |and|--"

"|And," added |Passepartout|, |"th|at would |play |the |game| o|f |th|e gen|tlem|en|
of th|e Reform| Club|.  |In four days we sh|all| be |in |New York|.  |Well|,
if m|y m|aster| |d|oes not l|e|ave t|his c|ar d|uring t|hose| |fo|ur| |days|,

|The| co|n|versation |dr|o|pped|.  |Mr. Fogg| had |just |wo|ke |up|,|
|and |w|as |lo|ok|ing o|ut of the |window|.  |Soon| after P|a|ssepartout|,|
|without |being h|e|ard| by hi|s master |or |Aouda|, |wh|ispered |t|o |the d|etective|,
|"W|ould you |re|ally |f|ight| |for |him|?"

"|I |would do| any|thing|," re|plied |Fix|, in a t|one |wh|ich |be|trayed| |determined| wi|ll|,
"|to get h|im| back| |living| to |Europe|!"

|Passepartout |felt |some|thing like a| sh|udder| s|hoo|t t|hrough| h|is f|r|am|e,
but |h|is c|on|fiden|ce| in| hi|s |mas|ter| r|e|mained| unbroke|n|.

|Was the|re| a|ny mea|ns |of| de|ta|ining Mr. Fogg| in |th|e c|ar, |to |avoid a| meeting|
b|etween hi|m a|nd t|he |c|olonel|?  |It |ought |not| to| be |a difficult task|,
|since that |gentleman |was |n|atural|ly |sed|e|ntary| |and |li|ttle| c|urious|.
|The| |detectiv|e|, |a|t |least|, s|eemed to have| |found |a |wa|y;| f|or, after a |few |moment|s|,
|he |said| t|o |Mr. Fogg|, |"|The|se are l|ong and |s|l|ow| hours|, sir, |th|at |we |are |passing|

"|Yes|," re|plied |Mr. Fogg|; "|but |they |pass|.|"

|"|You were i|n the habit o|f |playing| whist|,|" re|s|umed Fix|, "|on the |steamer|s|."

|"|Y|es|; |but |it| w|ould |be d|ifficult t|o |do so |here|.  |I ha|ve| n|ei|ther| c|a|rds

|"|Oh, |but we |can e|a|sily b|uy |some c|ard|s|, |for |the|y |are so|ld|

"|Certainly|, |sir|,|" |Aouda |qui|ckly re|p|lied|; "I understand |whist|.
|I|t |is pa|rt |of a|n |English| e|ducation|."

"|I |myself| h|ave |some |pre|te|ns|ions| to| p|la|ying| a g|ood g|ame|.
|Well, here| are| thr|e|e o|f u|s, a|nd |a |du|mmy--|"

"|As |you| pleas|e, sir|,|" replied |Phileas Fogg|, |heartily| gla|d
t|o |res|u|me his f|avourite pa|stime| e|ven on the |r|ail|way|.|

|Passepartout w|as |d|is|patched| |in s|ea|rch of the |ste|ward|,|
|and s|oon |re|turn|ed |w|ith t|wo p|acks of |car|ds, s|o|me |pi|ns|,

|The| |game |co|mm|enced|.  Aouda |under|st|ood| w|his|t |suffic|ient|ly w|ell|,|
|and e|ve|n received |some| |co|mpliment|s |on |he|r| |pla|ying |from |Mr.| |Fogg|.
|As for |the |de|tective|, |he |was |simply an a|dept|,| and |w|orthy| |of| |being|
m|at|ch|ed against |hi|s |p|r|esen|t |op|po|ne|nt|.

"|Now,|" th|ought |Passepartout|, |"we|'ve got hi|m.  |He wo|n't b|udge|.|"

|At eleven |in the morning| t|he |train |had |reached |the| d|ivid|ing| r|idge of| the |waters|
|a|t |Br|idge|r |Pass, |s|e|ve|n |thousand five hundred| |and |twenty|-four |feet above
t|he level of the sea|, on|e of the |highe|st| |point|s |attain|ed by the| t|ra|ck|
|in |c|ross|ing the |Rocky Mountains|.  |After |going |about |two hundred |miles|,
|the |tra|vellers| at| l|ast f|ou|nd |the|mselves| |on o|n|e of| th|ose |vast |plain|s|
w|hich |extend| t|o |the |Atlantic|, and |which| n|ature ha|s m|ade| |so pr|o|pitious|
|f|or l|aying the| |iro|n| road|.

|On| the |decli|vity of the |Atlantic| b|a|sin the |first| |st|reams|,
|branch|es o|f |the |North| |Platte River|, |already |appeared|.|
|The |w|hole |north|ern |and e|astern ho|rizo|n was bounded| by |the |immense|
|semi-|circu|la|r |curtain |which |i|s |formed by |the| s|o|uther|n p|or|ti|on|
of |the |Ro|cky Mountain|s|, |the |highest b|eing |L|aramie |P|eak.|
|B|et|ween t|his and the |ra|ilway |e|xt|ended vast pl|ain|s|,
pl|e|nt|iful|ly |i|rrig|at|ed|.  |On the |right| r|ose the lo|wer |s|purs
of the m|ountain|ous| m|ass which |extend|s southward| to |the |s|our|ce|s
of |the |Ar|kan|sas| River|, o|n|e of the gr|eat tri|butaries |o|f the |Mi|ssouri|.
|
|A|t |half-past |twe|lve| the tra|vellers |caught |si|ght for an inst|ant| of Fort |Halleck|,
which |command|s th|at| |sec|tion|; |and i|n |a few m|ore| ho|ur|s |the |R|o|cky Mountains|
|were |c|ro|ssed.  |There| w|as |r|ea|son |to |h|ope|, then, |that no |accident| w|ould |ma|r|k
the| |journey through |th|is |d|ifficult| cou|ntry|.  |The |snow |had |c|eased fa|lling|,
|and |th|e |air| b|ecame |cris|p and |cold|.  |La|rge bird|s, fr|ight|ened by the |locomotive|,
rose an|d flew off |in t|he |d|ist|ance|.  |No| wild b|east a|ppeared| on |the| p|la|in|.
|It was |a| |desert| |in it|s |vast| na|ked|ness.|

|A|fter a |co|m|fortable b|reakfast|, ser|ved in t|h|e |car|, Mr. Fogg| a|nd |hi|s p|art|ner|s had|
|ju|st |re|sumed |wh|ist|, |wh|en a |violent |whi|st|ling was| |heard|, |and |the |train| st|o|pp|ed|.
|Passepartout| p|u|t his |h|ead o|ut of the door|, but saw not|hing| |to |c|ause| the |delay|;
no s|tat|ion| |was |in |view|.|

|Aouda |and |Fix| f|eared that |Mr. |Fogg |might |t|ake it in|to |his |h|ead| |to g|et| |out|;
but |th|at |gentleman| |co|nte|nted himself with |saying| t|o hi|s s|ervant|,
|"|Se|e |what |is |the m|atter|."

|Passepartout| r|ushed o|ut of the |car|.  |Th|irty o|r fo|rty| pa|ssen|gers|
|had al|ready |d|e|scended|, |amo|ngst them| |Colonel| Stamp Proctor|.

The |tra|in| had st|opped| before| a |red| s|ig|nal| |which |block|ed |the |way|.
|The| engineer |and |conduc|tor| were |t|alking| |e|xcitedly w|ith a |s|i|gnal|-|man|,
|whom |the |station|-mast|er |at |Medicine Bow|, |th|e| |ne|xt |st|op|ping p|lace,|
|had sent on b|efore|.  The| |pa|ssengers| dr|ew |a|round |and |t|ook |part|
i|n the |dis|cussion|, |in which |Col|onel |Proctor|, w|ith |his |in|sol|ent m|a|nner|,
|was |co|n|spicuous|.

|Passepartout|, |jo|in|ing |th|e| g|roup, |h|eard |th|e |si|g|nal|-ma|n |say|,
|"|No|! you ca|n|'t pass.|  |Th|e |br|idge |at |Medicine Bow| is |shaky,|
|and |w|ould |not |be|ar the |weig|ht of |the train|."

|Th|is |w|as a |sus|pension|-b|ri|dge| t|hrown o|ver| so|me r|apid|s|, a|bo|ut| a|
mi|le from |t|he |pla|ce| where |the|y |now |were|.  |Acco|rding to |the|
|s|ig|nal-m|an|, it was |in |a r|uinous c|ond|ition|, s|everal of| th|e i|ron
wi|re|s |b|eing |b|roken|; |and |it |was |i|mp|ossible| to r|is|k t|he p|ass|age|.
|He d|id not |in| |an|y |way e|xa|gge|rat|e |the co|ndition of| the br|idge|.|
|It may be |tak|en f|or gr|anted| that|, r|as|h as |the| |American|s| u|suall|y| a|re|,|
w|he|n the|y are pr|udent| there |is |good |rea|son f|or |it.|
|
|Passepartout|, |not |daring| to a|ppr|ise| hi|s m|a|ster| o|f what| |he h|eard|,|
|listened |with |s|et |teeth|, immovable| a|s |a s|tatue|.

|"Hum|!" |cried |C|olonel Proctor|; "|but |we |are |no|t go|ing| to |stay| here|,
|I imagine|, a|nd |t|ake |r|oo|t |in |the snow|?|"

"|Co|lonel|," replied| |the |co|nductor|, "|w|e have te|legraph|ed to |Omaha| for a t|rain|,
b|ut it is |not |li|kely t|hat it |will |re|ach| |Medicine| B|ow |is |less than| si|x hours|."

"|Si|x |hours|!|" cried |Passepar|tout|.

"|Certainly|," |re|turned |the |con|ductor|, "|besides, i|t |will |take u|s |a|s |long|
as |that |to rea|ch |Medicine |Bow |on f|oot|.|"

|"|But| |it is| on|ly a |mi|le| from |here|," said |one| of the |p|assengers.

"Y|es|, but |it|'s |on |the other| s|ide of| |the |r|iver|.|"

|"A|nd |can|'t |we cro|ss th|at |in |a |bo|at|?"| asked the| |colonel|.

"|That|'s |impossible|.  |The| c|re|ek| is sw|elled b|y the r|a|ins|.  |It |is |a r|a|pid|,
|an|d |w|e shall |h|ave |to make |a |c|ircuit o|f |t|en |mi|le|s t|o t|he north| to| |fin|d |a |ford."

Th|e |co|lon|el |l|au|nch|ed a| volley o|f |oa|ths|, |d|eno|unc|ing the |r|a|il|way
c|ompan|y and |the| |co|nd|uctor|; |and| |Passepartout|, w|ho| |wa|s |furious|,
w|as |not |d|isin|cli|ned to |make |common |c|au|se| with| |hi|m.|  |Here| w|as|
a|n obs|tacle|, indeed|, |whi|ch |all his |master|'s |ba|nknotes| cou|ld not| |re|mo|ve|.
|
|The|re| was |a g|eneral| d|isapp|ointment| among the |p|ass|enger|s|, |who|,
|w|ith|out r|e|ckoning |the de|lay, |saw the|mselves| |co|mpel|led| t|o |trudge|
|fi|fteen miles| |over| |a |pla|in| |co|vered |with| |snow|.  |They |grum|bled |an|d
pro|tested|, |and |would |certainly have |t|hus |a|ttract|ed |Phileas Fogg|'s|
|att|ention i|f |he had not |been |complete|ly |ab|sorbed| in |hi|s |game.

|Passepartout f|ound |th|at| he could |not |avoid |tell|ing h|i|s master| w|hat
|had |o|ccur|re|d, |a|nd|, |with |ha|n|ging |h|ead|, h|e |was |turning to|wards the| c|ar|,
wh|en the en|gineer |a t|ru|e |Ya|nkee, n|amed For|ster ca|lled| out,|
|"Gentlem|en|, p|erhaps| |the|re |is |a way|, after |all|, to get| over|."

|"On |th|e |b|ridge|?" asked |a p|asse|nger|.

"|On th|e br|idge|."

"|With o|ur train|?"

"|Wi|th| |our t|ra|in|."

|Passepartout| s|topped| |sh|ort, |and |ea|ge|r|ly| l|iste|ned |to |the |engineer|.

"|But| the br|idge| is |un|safe|,|" |urged |the c|onductor|.

"|No| ma|tter|," replied| F|orste|r; "|I |think| that| by p|utt|ing |on |the|
|very |h|ighest| |speed |we might |have |a| |cha|nce| of |getting o|ver|.|"

"|The |de|vil|!" muttered |Passepartout|.

|But| a |n|umber of |the |pa|ssengers| were| a|t once |a|ttract|ed b|y the|
e|ngineer|'s p|ro|posal|, and |Colonel |Proctor| |was |especially |delighted|,
and |fo|u|nd |th|e| p|la|n a very |fea|sible o|ne.|  H|e |t|old |s|to|ries |about|
e|ngineer|s l|eaping| the|ir tra|in|s |o|ver |ri|ver|s |without |bridge|s,|
b|y p|utting on |f|ull steam|; and m|any |o|f those p|re|sen|t avowe|d
th|emselves |o|f the engi|neer|'s |mind.|
|
|"|We have f|ifty |c|ha|nces| out| of |a h|u|ndred o|f ge|tting |over|," said |one|.

"|Eighty!| ninet|y!"

|Passepartout| |was |as|to|und|ed|, |and|, th|ough| re|ad|y to |attempt an|y|thing| to| |get
|over M|edicine| Cr|eek|, th|ought| the| e|x|periment p|ro|p|osed| |a li|ttle to|o America|n|.
"|Be|sides," thought |he, |"th|ere|'s a |still| more |si|mple| way|, and i|t |d|oes| not| e|ven|
o|ccu|r |to any of the|se| |pe|ople|!  Sir|," said |he| a|loud |to one| of the| |p|assengers|,
|"|the |engine|er|'s plan s|ee|ms to |me |a |little |dangerous|, |but|--|"

|"|Eighty| c|hances|!"| replied |the |passe|nger|, |turning |his b|a|ck |on hi|m.|
|
|"|I| know| |it|," |said |Passepartout|, |t|urning |to |an|other| |passe|nger|,|
|"but a si|mpl|e |idea|--"

"|I|deas| a|re no| use|,|" re|turned |the |American|, s|h|ru|gging his shou|lder|s|,
|"|as |the e|ngineer| a|ss|ure|s| us t|hat we| can |pass."

|"|Do|ubt|les|s|," urged |Passepartout|, |"we |can p|ass|, |but |p|erhaps| it would|
be |more |p|rudent|--"

"|What|!  |Pru|dent!|" cried |Colonel Proctor|, w|ho|m th|is |word |seemed|
to ex|cite| pro|digiously.|  |"|At full speed, |do|n't you see,| a|t |full s|peed!"

"|I know|--|I s|ee|," rep|eated |Passepartout|; "|but |it w|ould be|, |if |not m|o|re p|rudent|,
|si|nce |that |word d|ispl|ea|se|s| you|, a|t least| |more natural|--"

"|Wh|o!  |What|!  |What|'s the matter| with| |th|is |fellow|?"| c|ried| |several|.|
|
|The| poor fellow |did not |know| t|o |wh|om to a|ddre|ss| h|i|mself|.

|"|A|re you |afraid|?" asked |Colonel |Proctor|.

"|I afraid?|  |Very well|; I |will sh|ow |th|ese people| t|hat |a| Frenchman
can be |as American| a|s the|y|!"

"A|ll| aboard!" |cried |the |c|o|nductor|.
|
"|Y|es|,| |all |abo|ard!|" |repeated |Passepartout|, |and |immediately|.
|"|But| th|e|y |c|an|'t pr|event me| from |thin|king that it w|ould| b|e |more |natural|
for| u|s to| cro|ss the |br|i|dge| on |foot|, |and |let |the| tra|in| co|m|e after|!"
|
|But| no| |one| hear|d |t|his |sage |re|flecti|on|, |no|r w|o|uld |anyone| have |ac|kno|wledg|ed
i|t|s j|ustice|.  |The| passengers| re|sumed the|ir places |in the| |car|s.
|Passepartout| t|ook |his |seat| without| te|lling| w|hat had |p|ass|ed|.
|The |wh|ist|-player|s were |quit|e absorbed| |in the|ir |game|.|
|
|The| |locomotive| w|histled| v|i|go|rously|; the |engine|er, re|ve|rsing t|he |st|e|am|,
|ba|cked th|e |tr|ain |for| |nearly |a |mile--ret|iring|, l|ike a |jum|per, |i|n |order|
t|o |take |a| |longer| l|eap.  |Th|en, w|ith |another |whis|tle, he began to |move| for|ward|;

a| prolon|g|ed |sc|re|ech |issued| from |the l|ocomotive|; |the p|iston |worked |up| a|nd |down|

|and th|re|e h|undred and |fi|ft|y|-se|ven mi|les h|ad |yet t|o |be| t|raversed|
before |re|aching |Omaha|.  |The| ro|ad |fo|llowed the capricious| windi|ngs
of th|e |s|outhern branch| of the |Pl|atte River|, |on its |left |bank|.
A|t n|ine |the |tra|in |stopped| at |th|e |i|mpo|rtant| t|own| of| North| |Platte|,|

T|he| o|ne hundred and |first meridian| w|as p|assed|.

|Mr. Fogg| a|nd his |pa|rt|ners |had| re|sumed |their |gam|e|; no o|n|e--|not |e|ve|n the| |du|mmy--|
co|mpl|ained of |the |length of |the |tr|ip|.  F|ix| had |begun |by win|n|ing| |se|veral|

f|a|voured that g|en|tleman|.  |Tru|mps |and ho|nour|s |were| s|ho|wered |upon |his |hands|.
|
|On|ce,| having |resolved o|n |a bold |str|oke,| |he was |o|n the |point| of |playing| a |sp|ade|,
|w|hen |a v|oice| |behind| |him| s|ai|d|, |"|I |should |play a |di|amond|."

|Mr. Fogg, |Aouda,| a|nd |Fix| ra|ised their hea|d|s, and |be|held Colonel Proctor|.

|St|amp Proctor| a|nd |Phileas Fogg| r|e|cognised| each |other| a|t |once|.

|"|A|h|! it|'s you|, is |it|, |English|man|?"| |cried the |colonel|;
"it|'s you| |w|ho| a|re going to |play| a |sp|ade|!"
|
|"|An|d wh|o pla|ys| it," |re|plied |Phileas Fogg| c|o|olly|,
|th|ro|wing| |down t|he |ten of |spa|des|.

"|Well, it p|l|ease|s me to have it |d|iamonds|,|"
|re|plied |Co|lonel Proctor|, in |a|n |i|ns|olent |to|ne|.

|He |m|ade |a |movement a|s if |t|o sei|ze |th|e |ca|rd w|hich |had just |been p|layed|,

|"|P|erhap|s| I do,| as |well| as| |a|nother," |said |P|hileas Fogg|, |ri|sing.

|"You have| o|nly |to t|ry|, |son| o|f| |John Bul|l," re|plied the co|lonel|.

|Aoud|a turn|ed |pale|, and her b|lood r|an |c|old|.  |She |se|ized |Mr. Fogg|'s|
a|rm| a|nd g|entl|y pull|ed |him| |back|.  |Passepartout was| ready| to |poun|ce
up|on |the| American|, |wh|o| was |st|ar|i|ng |i|nsolently at |his |oppo|ne|nt|.
|But| |Fix |got up|, and|, going to |Colonel Proctor| said,| "|Y|ou forget
|that |it is I |wi|th |wh|om| you have |t|o |d|eal|, |sir|; |for it w|as I
w|hom you |not| only |insulted|, |but |st|ruck|!"

|"|Mr. Fi|x," |said |Mr. Fogg|, "p|a|rdon |me, |b|ut t|his affair is |mine,

|"|Wh|en an|d |wh|ere| |you w|ill|," |replied |the |American|, |"and with |wh|at|ever|

|Aouda in v|ai|n |attempted |to re|tain |Mr. Fogg|; |as v|ain|ly |di|d t|he|

t|o |th|row th|e c|o|lon|el| out| of the |window|, |but| |a sign| |from |his |master|
|che|ck|ed him|.  |Phileas Fogg| l|eft| t|he |car, and t|he |American |f|ollowed|
hi|m| upon |the pl|atform|.|  |"|Sir,|" said |Mr. Fogg| to |hi|s a|dversary|,
|"I| am |in |a| |great hurry| to get| b|ack| |to |E|urope|, |and |a|ny delay| w|hat|ever|
|wi|ll be |greatly t|o |my d|isa|dvantage|."

|"|Well|, what|'s that| t|o |me|?"| |rep|lied| |Colonel| Proctor|.
|
"|Sir|," said |Mr. |Fogg|, |very politely|, "|after our me|eting |a|t San Francisco|,
|I det|ermined| t|o re|turn to |America| a|nd |find you |as |soon as| I had |co|mpleted|

"|Really!|"|

"|Will you |a|ppoint| |a me|eting| fo|r six m|onths| hence|?"

"|Why| not| t|en year|s h|en|ce?"

|"|I |s|ay s|ix |mon|ths|," re|turned |Phileas Fogg|; "and |I |shall |be|

"A|ll| this is a|n |e|vasion|," cr|ied |Stamp P|roctor|.|  "|Now or n|ever|!"

"|Very go|od|.  |You |are going| to |New York|?"

"|No.|"

"|T|o |Chi|cago|?"

"No|."

"|T|o |Omaha|?"

"|What |diff|ere|nce| is |it t|o| you|?|  |Do| you know| Plum C|reek|?"

"|No|,|" |replied |Mr.| F|ogg|.
|
|"|It's |the next st|ation|.  |The t|ra|in| w|ill be t|here in a|n| ho|ur|,
and |will |stop t|here| t|en mi|nutes|.  |I|n |ten m|i|nutes |se|veral|

|"|Very well|,|" |said |Mr. Fogg|.|  |"I |will st|op |at |Pl|um Creek|."

"|And |I |gue|ss you|'ll| s|tay |th|e|re| t|oo|," a|dded |the American| insolently.|
|
"|Who |kn|ows|?"| replied |Mr. Fogg|, |re|turning to |the c|ar| |as c|oolly as |usual|.
|He began to rea|s|sure |Aouda|, t|elli|ng h|er| that| blustere|r|s we|re |ne|ver
t|o |b|e |feared|, and |be|gged |Fix to |be |h|is| s|econd| at th|e a|pp|roach|ing| d|u|el,
a| re|qu|est which |the |detective| c|ould not |re|fuse|.  Mr. Fogg re|sumed
t|he |inter|rupt|ed |game| |with |per|fect| |c|al|mnes|s.|

|At e|le|ven o'clock |the |locomotive|'s w|histl|e| a|nnoun|ced |t|hat| the|y were
|approach|ing |Plu|m Creek| station|.  |Mr. Fogg |rose|, a|nd|, |followed by| |Fix|,
w|e|nt out |upon the pla|tf|orm|.|  |Passepartout| a|ccompanied| hi|m|, |ca|rrying
|a pa|ir o|f revolvers|.|  |Aouda| |re|mained| |in| the |c|ar|, |a|s |pale a|s| d|eath.|

The |door| of the next |ca|r |opened|, |and |Col|onel |Proctor| a|pp|eared| on the| |pl|atform|,
|at|tended by a Ya|nkee of his o|wn |st|amp as| h|is second|.  |B|ut |just |as |the|
c|om|batan|ts we|re |about |to |s|tep |from |the |train|, |the| |co|n|ductor h|urried up|,
and |sh|o|u|ted|, "|You| |can|'t get |of|f, g|entlemen|!|"

|"|Wh|y not?|" asked |the c|ol|onel|.

"|We are |twe|nty| |minutes |lat|e|, and we| s|hall| |not |sto|p."

|"But| I am going to |fi|ght| a |due|l |with| |th|is gentleman|."

|"I am |sorry|,|" said |the |con|ductor|; "but |we s|hall |be o|ff at once|.
|Th|e|re's the |bell| r|i|nging |now|."

|The| |tra|in| start|ed.|

"|I'm real|ly| |very |sorry|, gentlem|en," |said |the |con|ductor|.
|"|Unde|r an|y other c|ircu|mstances I |sh|ould have |been |h|app|y| to o|blig|e you|.
|But|, a|fter |all|, as |you |have |not |had t|ime to |f|ight |here|,|
|wh|y not f|ight |as w|e| g|o a|lon|g|?|

"|Th|at| |w|ouldn't |be| c|on|venient|, p|erhaps|, |for| this |gentleman|,"
said the co|lonel|, |in a j|eer|ing tone|.

|"It| w|ould be |p|erfectly |so|,|" replied |Phileas Fogg|.

|"W|ell, |we| are |really in |America|," th|ought P|assepartout|,
"and |the con|ductor |is |a gentl|eman of the |f|irst| order|!"

|So |muttering|, he followed| his |master|.

|Th|e |two com|batants|, t|he|ir |sec|ond|s, |and |the| |c|onductor |passed| th|rough|
the |c|ars |to |the r|ear| of the |t|rain|.  |The| la|st |car| |was only |occ|upied|
by |a |d|o|zen passen|ger|s, |who|m |the c|on|ductor p|ol|ite|ly| a|sked if| |they |w|ould
|not be| s|o kind |as to |leave |it v|aca|nt for |a f|ew |moments|, |as two gentlem|en
|had |a|n| a|f|fair| o|f honour| to s|ett|le.  |The| p|a|ssengers| granted th|e r|equest
|with a|l|ac|rity|, |and |stra|ight|way |disappeared |o|n |the |pla|tform|.|

|Th|e |c|ar|, w|hich was s|ome |fi|fty |fee|t |lo|ng|, |was v|ery |c|o|nvenient
for| |their purpose|.  |Th|e adv|ersaries might m|arch |o|n e|ach other|
in the aisle, and| |f|ire a|t th|e|ir e|ase|.|  |Never| w|as |duel| more easi|ly|
arr|ange|d.|  |Mr. Fogg a|nd| |Colonel| |Proctor|, e|ach p|r|o|vi|ded| with| |t|wo|
|s|ix|-barrel|led |r|evol|vers|, |en|ter|ed| t|he c|ar|.  The |seconds,| re|maining|

wh|at remained o|f the |two| gen|tle|men w|ould |be |taken from th|e c|ar|.|
|
Noth|ing| |co|uld |be m|ore |simpl|e.|  |Inde|ed, |it was |al|l s|o si|mple|
t|h|at |F|ix |and P|assepartout| felt |the|ir hea|rt|s |bea|ting| a|s |i|f |the|y
|would| crac|k.|  They were l|isten|ing f|or the| w|histle| agreed| upon|,|
|wh|e|n |suddenly |savage| cries |re|so|unded| in t|he air|, a|cco|mpanied
by re|ports| w|hich c|ertain|ly |did not |issu|e| from |the |ca|r wh|ere|
|the |d|uellists were|.  |The| reports |con|tinued |in |front a|nd |the |who|le|
l|ength of |the| t|r|ain|.  |Crie|s o|f te|rror| proceeded| from the| |in|terior
of th|e |c|ars.|

|Colonel Proctor| a|nd |M|r. Fogg|,| revolv|ers| in h|and|, |hasti|l|y quitted
|the|ir pr|ison|, |and |r|ush|ed |forward where the |no|ise| wa|s m|ost |cl|amorou|s|.
|They th|en |perceived |th|at |the |t|rain |was| |at|tacked by| |a ba|nd |o|f |S|ioux|.
|
|Th|is |was no|t |the first attempt| o|f the|se |da|ri|ng| India|ns|, |f|o|r |more| than
on|ce |the|y |had w|aylaid train|s |on |the |r|oad|.|  A |hundred| of them| |had|,|
|a|cco|rding to the|ir |habit|, |ju|mp|ed upon the |steps w|ithout s|t|opping|
the tra|in|, |with the| e|ase of |a clo|wn m|ount|ing| a |horse |at ful|l |gallo|p.

|The |Sioux w|ere |armed with |guns, |f|rom w|hich| |came |th|e |re|port|s|,
|to |wh|ich the |pass|engers|, |who| w|ere |a|lmost |all |ar|med|, re|spo|nded|
by |revolver-|shots|.

|The Indian|s had fi|rst| m|ou|nte|d t|he engine|, and |half |s|tunned|
the engineer and stoke|r| with |blo|ws |from the|ir m|us|ke|ts|.
|A Sioux |c|hief|, |wishing to |s|top t|he |train|, |but no|t kn|owing|
|h|ow to w|ork the |re|gula|tor, |had |opened |wide |in|stead of |cl|osing
the| s|t|eam|-va|lve, and| |the| l|ocomotive| |w|as |plunging for|ward|
w|ith| t|err|if|ic| velo|city|.

The |Sioux |had |a|t |th|e |same ti|me |in|vaded| the c|ar|s, |s|ki|pp|ing like
enr|aged |mo|nkeys o|ver th|e |roof|s|, t|hrusting o|pen the |doors|,|
|and |f|ighting |hand t|o h|and |with the |p|a|ssengers|.  |Pe|netrating |the|
b|aggage|-car|, they |pillage|d |it|, |th|rowing| the| tr|unks| |ou|t of the |tra|i|n|.
|The| cries |and |sho|ts w|ere c|onst|ant.|  |The| tra|velle|rs |de|fended|
the|m|selves |br|ave|ly|; so|me |of the |car|s were |ba|rrica|de|d,|
|and |sustained |a| si|eg|e, |like |mov|i|ng f|or|t|s, |c|arr|ied al|ong|
at |a s|peed o|f |a |hundred |miles| a|n hour|.

|Aouda |b|eh|aved co|u|rageous|ly |f|rom th|e f|irst|.  |S|he d|ef|ended her|self
l|ike a tr|ue |he|roine |with |a| revolv|er|, |w|hich |she |shot |th|rough| the br|oken|
|wind|ows |wh|enever a |savage |made h|i|s |appearance|.  |Tw|enty| |Sioux |had| |fallen
|mo|r|tally w|ounded to |the |ground,| and| |the| w|h|eels| c|rushed| th|ose w|ho |fell
up|on |the| |rails a|s if |they had |been| wor|ms.|  |Several |p|assengers|,
s|ho|t or |st|un|n|ed, |lay| on the seats.|

|It was necessary t|o |put an |end |to |the s|truggle|, |which had laste|d
|for| ten mi|nutes|, |and |wh|ich| w|o|uld |re|sult |in |the |tri|ump|h of the |Si|oux|
i|f th|e |tra|in| |wa|s |no|t |stop|ped|.  |Fort |Kea|rney| st|a|tion|, wh|ere |the|re| was|
a g|arri|son, |was |on|ly t|wo mi|le|s distant; but|, th|at| o|nce| pa|sse|d|,
|th|e Sioux would |be |m|aster|s of |the |tr|ain| between |Fort Kearney|
a|nd th|e |stat|ion| beyond|.

|The co|n|ductor w|as |fi|ghting| be|side |Mr. Fogg|, wh|en he |was |sho|t |an|d f|ell|.
A|t |th|e sa|me |moment| he |cr|ied, "Un|less| the| train| is st|opped in| five |minut|es|,
|w|e are |los|t!"

|"It |shall be |st|opped|," said |P|hileas Fogg|, |preparing to| |rush |from the| c|ar|.

|"Stay|, m|onsieur|," cr|ied |Passepartout|; "|I| |will go|."

|M|r. F|ogg| had |not |time to |s|top| |the |br|ave| f|ell|ow|, |w|ho|, |opening |a |door
|un|perc|eived by |the |Indian|s, |su|c|ceeded| in |slipp|ing| u|nder| the |c|ar|;

and th|us gain|ing |the |forward end| of the |train|.
|

whi|l|st |the |locomotive| r|ushed| forward with |in|creased| s|peed.

|killed |in |the |s|t|ruggle|?  W|ere the|y |taken p|r|ison|ers| by th|e |Sioux|?
I|t was |impossible t|o tell|.

|The|re| w|ere |man|y wounded|, |but n|o|ne |mor|tal|ly|.|  |Colonel| Proctor| was |on|e
o|f the |m|ost |se|r|iously hur|t; he had |fought| bravely|, a|nd a| b|a|ll |ha|d e|ntered|
|hi|s groin|.  |He w|as |ca|rried| in|to the |st|at|ion| with |th|e |other| w|ounded| pa|ss|enger|s|,
|to| re|ceive| s|uch |a|tt|ention |as |could |be o|f| av|ail|.|
|
|Aouda| |was s|afe; and |Phileas Fogg|, who| had |been| in| t|he |t|hicke|st
of |the |f|ight|, |had |not |re|ceived |a |scratch.  F|ix| was |sl|ightly|
w|ounded |in th|e| arm.  |But |Passepartout| was| |no|t |t|o b|e |fo|und|,
|and |te|ar|s c|o|u|rsed down |Aouda|'s |c|heeks|.

|All th|e |p|a|sse|nger|s |had |got o|ut| of the |train|, |th|e |wh|eels|
of |which |were |s|tained| with |blood|.  |From t|he |tyre|s and s|p|okes

w|ere |disappearing in| the |s|outh|, |al|ong |the |ban|k|s of |Rep|ublican River|.

|Mr. |Fogg|, w|ith| folded |a|rms|, re|ma|ined| |mo|tionless|.  |He |had |a se|ri|ous
|de|cision| t|o| make|.  Aouda|, st|a|nding n|ear |him|, |looked at him with|out| s|pea|king|,|
|and h|e under|stood her| l|ook|.  |I|f his |s|ervant |w|as |a| p|rison|er|, |ou|ght h|e n|ot
to r|is|k |e|very|thing| to |re|s|cue |him from |the |Indian|s?  |"I |w|ill find hi|m,
|liv|ing or d|e|ad|," |said |he| qui|etly| t|o |Aouda|.

|"|Ah|, |Mr.|--|M|r. Fogg|!"| c|ried |she, c|l|asping his |hand|s
a|nd |cover|ing |them |with |t|ears.|

|"Livi|ng|,|" added |Mr. Fogg|, "|i|f we |do not |l|o|se |a |moment|.|"

|Phileas Fogg|, |b|y th|is r|e|solution|, |in|ev|ita|bl|y |sa|crifi|ced |hi|mself|;
|he pronounce|d his own |doom|.|  |The| d|elay |of |a |s|ingle| day| w|ould ma|ke|
him |l|ose the steamer| at |New York|, |and| his |bet w|ould be |certain|ly |lost|.
|But |as he thought|, |"I|t is |my duty,|" |he d|id not h|esitate|.

|T|he c|ommanding of|f|icer o|f |For|t Kearney| was t|here.  |A h|undred|
o|f his |soldiers |had |placed |the|mselves| in |a |po|sition| to| d|e|fend|
th|e |st|at|ion|, |sho|uld |the |Si|oux| a|ttack i|t.

|"|Sir," said |Mr. Fogg| to |the |c|aptain, |"thre|e passenger|s |ha|ve |disappeared|.|"
|
|"|Dea|d?" asked |the c|aptain|.

"|Dead or p|r|is|on|ers|; |th|at is |the uncertaint|y w|hich |must |be s|o|lved|.
|Do you p|ropose to pur|sue the |Sioux|?"

"|Th|at|'s a s|erious t|h|ing to do|, |sir|,|" re|turned the |c|aptain|.
"|These| Indian|s |m|ay re|t|reat |be|yond the| |A|rkan|sas|, |and |I| ca|nnot
leav|e |th|e f|ort| un|pr|otected|."

|"|The| l|ive|s |of| |th|ree |me|n a|re |in |question|,| s|ir,|" said |Phileas |Fogg|.

|"Do|ub|tless|; |but| can |I |ris|k the l|ives of fi|fty| |men |to save |three|?"

|"I don't know| whe|ther |you |can|, sir|; |but |you o|ught to do| so|."

|"|No|bo|dy |here," re|turned |the |other|, |"ha|s |a |r|ight| to teach| me| my |duty|."

"|Very |well|," |said |Mr. Fogg|, |co|ldly|.  "|I |will |go| alone|."

|"|You|, |sir|!" cried |Fix|, |co|m|ing |up|; "|you go alone| in| p|ursu|it| of the| |Indian|s|?"

"|W|ould you |have| me |le|ave |t|his |p|oor |fellow| |t|o p|er|ish|--
|h|im| to| whom e|very| on|e present |owes| his |li|fe|?  |I |sh|all |go."

|"|No|, sir|, you s|hall |not |go| a|lone|," cri|ed |the |captain|,
t|ouc|hed |in spi|te |of |him|self|.|  "|N|o! you |are a bra|ve| |man|.
|Th|irty volunteer|s!"| he added, t|urn|ing to the |s|oldier|s|.

|The |whole |company |s|tar|ted |for|ward| at |o|nce|.|  |The| c|aptain| had|
o|n|ly t|o |pick |hi|s |me|n.  |Th|irty |w|ere c|ho|se|n|, and |a|n old| ser|geant
|p|lac|ed |at |the|ir h|ead|.|

"|Th|a|nk|s, c|aptain|," |said |Mr. Fogg|.

|"|Will you |let me g|o| with |you?"| asked |Fix|.

"|Do as you please|, sir|.  |But |i|f you w|ish to |do| m|e |a| favour|,
you| will rem|ain w|ith| Aouda|.  |In c|ase a|ny|thing| s|ho|uld |happen to me|--|"

|A |su|dden |pal|lo|r o|ve|rspread |the detective|'s |face|.  |Separate h|imself
|from |the |man |wh|om he |had s|o p|ersistently fo|llowed |step| by s|te|p!
Leave |him t|o w|ander about i|n th|is |des|ert|!  |Fix |gazed a|tte|nti|vely|
|at |Mr. Fogg, |and|, d|es|p|ite| his s|u|sp|icions| and |o|f t|he| |st|r|uggle|
w|hich| w|as g|oing |on| withi|n hi|m|, |h|e |lo|w|ered| his |eyes| |befor|e that calm|
and f|ran|k |lo|ok|.
|
|"I |will s|t|ay," |said |he|.

|A| few |moments| a|fter|, |Mr. |Fogg| pres|sed| |the| young |woman|'s h|and|, and|,
|ha|ving co|nfide|d |to her |hi|s |pr|ec|ious |carpet-bag|, |we|nt |off| with| the |ser|geant|
a|nd h|is l|i|ttle s|quad|.  |But, |befo|re g|oing|, |he |had |said| t|o |the |s|oldier|s|,|
"|My fr|iend|s, |I |w|ill d|ivide| f|ive th|ousand |dollars| a|mong |you|, |if |we save
|the p|ri|soners|.|"

|It was |th|e|n |a |little| p|ast |noon|.
|
Ao|uda |ret|ired to a wa|iting|-room|, |and |th|e|re| |she w|aited |al|one,|
|th|inking o|f |the si|mple| and no|ble g|enero|sity|, t|he tr|a|nquil |co|urage
o|f P|hileas Fogg|.  |He |had |sacrificed| hi|s |fort|une|, a|nd |wa|s |no|w|
r|iski|ng hi|s life|, |a|ll wi|th|out| he|sita|t|ion|,| |from d|u|ty, |in s|i|lence|.
|
|Fix |did not |have |th|e |same th|ought|s, |and |could |sc|arcely| |co|ncea|l
his a|gi|tat|ion|.  |He wa|lked f|everish|ly u|p an|d d|own| the |platform|,
|but |so|on| re|s|umed his outward| c|omp|o|sure|.  |He n|o|w s|aw th|e |fo|ll|y of |which
|h|e |had |been |gui|lty |in| let|ti|ng |Fo|gg| g|o a|lone|.  |What|!  |This |ma|n|,
w|ho|m |he had |just |fo|llowed |ar|ound |the |world|, |was |perm|itted| no|w t|o
|separate himself |from |him|!  |He |bega|n to |accuse| |a|n|d a|bu|se| |himself|,
|and|, |a|s |i|f |h|e |were |di|rector| o|f police|, a|dminister|ed| to |him|self
a| |so|un|d |lecture| f|or his g|re|en|ness.|

|"I| have |been| an| i|diot|!" he |thought|, "and th|is ma|n will |s|ee it.
|H|e ha|s gone|, |and |won't |come |b|ack|!  |But |how |is it |that| I|, |Fix,|
who |ha|ve |in |my p|ocket a |wa|rrant f|or hi|s |arrest|, have |been|
|s|o |fa|scin|at|ed| by |h|im|?  |Deci|ded|ly, |I |am not|hing |but a|n |as|s!"|

|So rea|so|ned |t|he| detective|, |while |the hour|s |cre|pt b|y a|ll| too |slowly.
|He did not |kn|ow| |what to |do.|  |Some|times he |was |t|empted to| t|ell |Aouda al|l|;
but |he |could not |doubt| h|ow the young w|oman| |w|ould |receive| hi|s |c|onfide|nce|s.|
|W|hat |cou|rse s|hou|ld he t|ake|?  |He| thought| o|f p|ursu|i|ng |Fogg| a|cross|
the |v|a|st white plains|; |it| |did not seem| |imp|ossible t|hat| he |might |over|take| hi|m.|
F|oo|ts|t|eps were e|asily |pri|nt|ed o|n |the snow|!  |But s|oon|, un|der| |a n|ew sh|eet,|
|every i|mpri|nt w|ould be |effaced.

|Fix became d|isco|ura|ged|.  |He |felt| a s|o|rt of insurmountable |l|ong|ing
|to a|bandon| the |game| |alt|ogether.|  |He |could no|w l|eave| |For|t Kearney| station|,
a|nd |pursue| his jo|urney| |h|omeward| |in peace.|

T|oward|s t|wo |o|'clock| in| the af|ternoon|, |whi|le |it was s|nowing| hard|,
|lo|ng |whistl|e|s were hea|rd| |approaching |f|rom t|he |east|.  |A |great s|had|ow|,|
preced|ed by a| |wild l|ight|, s|l|ow|ly |adv|an|ced|, a|ppearing |s|till l|arger|
th|ro|ugh |the m|is|t|, wh|ich| gave |it a| fa|nt|astic| a|spect|.|  |No| |train|
was |expected| from th|e |eas|t|, |nei|ther |ha|d the|re been time |for |the| |su|cc|ou|r|
a|s|ked |for| by tel|egraph| t|o a|rr|ive|; the |tra|in |fro|m |Omaha| to |San F|rancisco|
|was |no|t |d|ue |t|ill the| next day|.  |The| mystery was |soon ex|plai|ned.
|
|The| lo|comotive|, |wh|ich |was |slowl|y |a|pp|roach|ing |with d|eafen|ing |whistle|s,
was th|at |which|, |ha|ving |been| d|etached from the| t|ra|in|, had |cont|inu|ed|
|it|s |r|oute| with s|uch |te|rri|fic| |rapidi|ty|, |c|ar|rying| of|f t|he |un|c|onscious|
|en|gineer| and |stoke|r.  I|t |had |run |se|veral |m|iles|, |wh|en|, |t|he| fir|e |bec|oming
|l|o|w| f|or wa|nt o|f |f|uel|, |the |steam| |had |sl|acken|ed|; |and |it had |f|i|nally s|t|opped|
|an hour |after|, some t|wenty| mi|les| beyond |F|ort |Kearney|.  |Neither t|he| e|ngineer|
|nor |th|e st|oker| w|as |dea|d, |and|, |a|fter |remaining |for s|ome |t|ime| |in the|ir |swoon,
|had com|e to |the|mselves|.  |The| tra|in| |had |then| s|t|opped|.  |The| engin|eer|, wh|en| he
|found |himself |in the |des|ert, |a|nd the |locomotive |without| car|s, |un|derst|ood|
|what had |happen|ed|.  |He could n|ot |imagine| ho|w |th|e |lo|comotive| had become|
s|e|parated |from |th|e train|; |but h|e |did not| |doubt| |that| the train| |l|eft| behind|
w|as |in |dis|tre|ss.

|He |did not |h|esitate| w|hat t|o d|o.|  |It |would |be |pru|dent to |co|n|tinue|
o|n to |Omaha|, |for |it would |be |dangerous| to re|turn to |the |tr|a|in,|
w|hich |the| India|n|s |might |still| be |engaged| in |pi|lla|ging.|
|Nevertheless|, he| |began t|o |re|b|ui|ld| th|e |fire in the |fur|nace|;
the |pr|e|ssure |aga|in m|ounted|, |and |the |locomotive| r|eturned|,|
|running |backward|s to |For|t Kearney|.  |This it |was wh|i|ch| was |wh|istling
|in |the mist|.|

|The t|ra|vellers were |glad to |see| t|he |locomotive| r|e|sume| it|s|
p|lace a|t the |head of the |train|.  |Th|e|y c|ould no|w |co|nt|inue
|th|e |journey |s|o |t|erribl|y |in|te|rrupt|ed|.|

|Aouda|, o|n |see|ing the l|ocomotive| co|m|e| up|, |hurried o|ut of the| station|,
and |asked| the c|o|nductor|, |"|A|re you going to start|?"

"|At |o|nce|, madam|."

"|But| |th|e p|risoners|,| o|ur |un|for|tunate| f|ellow|-tra|vellers|--"

"I| can|not| interrupt| |the t|rip|," replied |the |c|o|nductor|.
|"We |are a|lready t|h|ree |hours| behind| time|.|"

|"|An|d |wh|en |will |anot|her |t|ra|in| pass| h|ere| |from |San Francisco|?"

"|To|-morrow| e|vening|, m|adam|."

"|To-morrow| |evenin|g|!  |But |th|en it will be |t|oo |la|te|!  W|e must| |wait|--"

"|It is impossible|," re|sponded| the |co|nductor|.|  "|I|f |you |wish to| go|,
pl|ea|se ge|t in."
|
|"I| |will not |go|," said |Aouda|.
|
|Fix |had heard| th|is |con|ve|rsation|.  |A little| w|hi|le| be|fore|, whe|n the|re|
was no p|ros|pe|ct of |pro|ceed|ing| on |the| |journey|, |he had |made| up| his |mind|
t|o |leave |For|t Kearney|; but| now t|hat the train| was |the|re|, ready t|o |start|,
and |he h|ad |only |to |take |his |s|eat| |in the car|, an| ir|res|istibl|e |influence|
he|ld| him| b|ack|.  |The s|tation |platform |b|urned| hi|s fe|et|, |and |he |co|uld not| |st|ir.
|The co|n|fl|ict |in his |mind again| began|; anger a|nd f|ai|l|ure |sti|fl|ed him|.
|He wished |to |s|tr|uggl|e |on |to t|he |end|.

|M|eanwhile| |the| p|assengers| a|nd some o|f t|he |wound|e|d, a|mong the|m|
|Colonel Proctor|, |w|ho|se |in|j|urie|s were |se|rious|,| had t|aken their|
|p|laces |in |the tra|in|.  |Th|e| b|uz|zing of the |o|ver-h|eated| bo|iler| |was|
|h|eard|, and| t|he |steam was e|s|caping from |the |valves|.  |The |engin|eer|
w|h|istled, |t|he t|ra|in| s|tart|ed|, and s|oon |dis|appear|ed|, |mi|ngl|ing|
i|ts |whi|te| s|moke |w|ith |t|he| |eddies of the |d|e|ns|el|y f|a|ll|ing| s|now|.
|
|The| detective |had| |re|mained| behind|.|

|Se|veral |hours |p|ass|ed|.  |The |w|ea|ther| was |dis|mal, and |it |was |very c|o|ld|.
|F|ix| |sa|t motionl|e|ss| o|n |a b|ench |in the |stat|ion|; he |might| h|ave been|
t|h|o|ught |a|sleep|.  |Aouda|, despit|e the |storm|, |kept co|ming out|
of the |waiti|ng|-room|, |going |to |the| |end of th|e| |platform|,
|and |p|eering through the| |tempest of |s|now|, |as if |to |pierce|
|the mist wh|ich| na|rrow|ed |the |ho|rizo|n |around| h|e|r, |and |to |hear,
i|f |poss|ible|, |s|o|me| |wel|come| sound.  |She |heard| a|nd |saw| no|thing|.
|The|n she w|ould re|turn|, ch|il|led th|rough|, |to |issue| o|ut| |again
a|fter |th|e l|apse of a f|ew |moment|s|, |but |a|l|ways| |in v|ain|.
|
E|ve|ning |came, and |the |li|tt|le| b|a|nd h|ad not |re|turn|ed|.  |Wh|ere c|ould| |they be|?|
|H|ad they found |the| Indian|s, and |w|ere |the|y |hav|ing |a| co|nflict with| the|m,
o|r w|ere |they st|ill |w|ander|ing| amid| the |mist|?|  |The| c|om|mand|er of th|e fort|
|was a|nxious|, t|hough |he |tr|ied |to |c|onceal| h|is a|ppr|ehe|nsion|s.
|As night approach|ed|, |the s|now |f|ell l|ess |ple|ntiful|ly,|
bu|t it beca|me |in|tensely |cold|.  |A|bsolute| |silence| re|sted| |o|n |the| pla|in|s.
|Neither |fl|ight |of bird no|r| pa|ss|ing o|f b|east tro|ubled| the |p|erfect| cal|m|.

|Th|roughout |the n|ig|ht| Aouda, |fu|ll of| s|a|d |fore|bodi|ngs|, |h|er |hea|rt
|st|if|le|d with |an|gui|s|h, |w|ander|ed |about on| |the |v|erge |of the |pla|in|s.
|Her i|maginat|ion |c|ar|ri|ed he|r |fa|r o|ff|, and |sh|ow|ed her| innumerable d|angers|.
What |she |suff|ered t|hr|ough| the long |hour|s |i|t |wo|uld be |i|mpos|sible| t|o de|sc|ribe|.
|
|Fix| re|mained stationary i|n the |same |p|la|ce|, |but di|d not |s|leep|.|
|On|ce a| m|an |app|roach|e|d |and |sp|oke |to| him|,| |and| the| |de|tective|
|m|er|e|ly replied |by s|ha|king |hi|s h|ead.

|Thus |the |night |pas|sed|.  |At |da|wn|, |the |hal|f|-exti|ng|uished |dis|c |of| the |s|un
rose| above| |a| m|i|sty| h|ori|zo|n ; |but |it was no|w p|os|sible t|o re|cognise |o|bject|s
t|wo |miles of|f|.  |Phil|eas Fogg |and the |squad h|ad |go|ne southward|;
i|n |the |s|outh| |all |was |still |vacanc|y.|  I|t |was |the|n s|eve|n |o'clock|.

|The |captain|, |who was |real|ly |alarmed, did not kn|ow| what course| |to t|ake|.

|Sh|o|uld he s|end a|nother |detach|me|nt| to the |re|scue| of the| fir|st|?
|Sh|ould he |sa|cr|ifice| m|ore| m|en, |with |so |few |cha|n|ces o|f |s|aving| tho|se|
al|ready s|a|cr|ificed|?  His |hes|i|tat|ion| di|d |not |l|ast |lo|ng|,| h|owever|.

|Th|e| s|oldiers| |ru|shed |out| of |the| for|t, a|nd |half| a| m|il|e off |the|y
p|er|ceived |a li|ttle b|and re|turning |in |good |order.

|Mr. F|ogg |was mar|ching |at |th|eir |head|, and just| beh|ind| hi|m| were|
|Passepartout| and |the other |tw|o |tra|vellers|, |r|e|scu|ed from the| |Sioux.

|The|y had| met and fought| |the| Indian|s| ten miles |south o|f |Fort Kearney.|
|Sho|rt|ly be|fore t|he de|t|ach|ment |a|rr|ive|d|.  |Passe|partout| a|nd h|is |co|mpanion|s|
|had |begun| t|o |s|truggl|e |with |the|ir |captors|, |th|ree of| whom| the |Frenchman|
had |f|ell|ed |with |his |f|ist|s|, |whe|n |his |master |an|d the| |soldiers| ha|st|ened| up|
to the|ir relief.|

A|ll| w|ere wel|comed with| joyful |cries.|  Phileas Fogg| |di|str|ibuted|
t|he |re|ward |he |had |pro|mise|d |to |t|he |soldiers|, |while |Passepartout|,
n|ot |without re|ason|, |muttered |t|o h|imself|,| "|It must| |ce|rtain|ly |be|
|con|fe|ssed |that I| c|o|st| my master| |dea|r!|"

|Fix|, w|ith|out |saying |a |word|, |looked at |M|r. Fogg|, |and| it |would |have|
been |d|ifficult to |a|nal|y|se the |th|ought|s| w|hich s|t|ru|ggled |withi|n |him.
|As for Aouda, s|h|e t|ook h|er pr|o|tector|'s |hand| and |p|r|essed| it |in |her |own|,
|too much| |mo|ve|d t|o |s|pe|ak|.

Meanwhile|, Passepartout| was |lo|ok|ing |about for the |train|; he| th|ou|ght
|he |should f|ind |it th|ere|, read|y |to |start| for| |O|maha|, a|nd |he| h|ope|d
t|hat the| time |lost m|ight be re|gained.|

|"|Th|e t|rain|! the tra|in|!" cried |he.|

|"|Gone|," replied| Fix|.
|
"And |wh|en does the n|ext |train pass here|?"| said |Phileas Fogg|.

|"|No|t ti|ll th|is| evening|."

"|Ah|!"| |re|turned |the |impas|sib|le| gentleman qu|ietly.

|Phileas Fogg| |found |himself |twenty| hours| behind| time|.
|Passepartout|, |the| |i|n|voluntary cause of th|is |delay|, |was d|es|perate.
|He |had |ruined| his master|!
|
|At |this moment| the |detective| a|pproached| Mr. Fogg|, a|nd|,
lo|oking |him in|tently i|n| the |face|, |sa|id|:

"|It is a|bsolutely| nece|ssary|.|"

|"A|nd, i|f you|r |jour|ney| |had no|t |be|en inter|rupted |by the|se |Indian|s,

"|Yes; |with e|leven hours |to| |sp|are| before| th|e |s|teamer| l|e|ft|."

|"|Go|od!| you are |therefore| t|wenty| hours behind|.  |T|we|lve f|rom twenty|

"O|n f|oot|?"| asked |Mr. Fogg.|

"|No|; |on a| sledge|," |rep|lied |Fix|.|  |"|On a sledge| with s|a|ils|.
A m|an |has pro|pos|ed| |such a| m|e|thod |t|o |me.|"

|It was |th|e |m|a|n |who| |had |spoke|n t|o Fix| |during the |night|, and|
w|ho|se o|ff|er| h|e had |re|fused|.|

|Phileas Fogg| |di|d not |re|ply| at once|; but |Fix|, |ha|ving p|ointed out t|he |m|an|,
|who| was |wa|lking |up and down| in| |fr|ont| of the |station,| Mr. Fogg| went up |to |hi|m.
A|n in|sta|nt |after|, |Mr. Fogg| |and |the |American|, |whose n|ame| was |Mud|ge,
|en|tered |a| hut buil|t just below th|e| fort|.

|The|re| Mr. Fogg| e|xa|min|ed a |c|urious |v|e|hicle|, a| kind of |frame |on two| lo|ng b|eams|,
a| little r|ai|sed in |front l|i|ke t|he |r|unners of a| |sledg|e|, |and |up|on |whic|h| |the|re|
was |ro|om f|or| f|i|ve| or si|x| p|ersons.  |A| h|igh |m|ast |was |fi|xe|d o|n the| fr|ame|,| h|eld|
|fir|ml|y |by |metall|ic l|ashings, t|o |wh|ich| was |at|tac|hed| a l|arge b|r|igantin|e| sail|.
|Th|is mast he|ld |a|n i|ro|n s|tay |upon |which |t|o |hoi|st| a| |jib-|sa|il.  B|ehind,| a| sort
of r|udder |serv|ed to guide| t|he |ve|hicle|.|  I|t |was|, in |s|hor|t, a| sl|edge| ri|g|ged
|li|ke a |sl|oo|p.  |During the| |winter|, |whe|n the |train|s a|re blo|ck|ed| up| by| the s|now|,
|the|se |s|l|edges| |ma|ke| e|xtr|emely |r|apid| journey|s across| the |fro|zen| pla|ins| from |one|
|st|ation| to |an|other.  |Provide|d |with |mo|re |sails| than |a c|utter|, |and |with the| |wind|
be|hind |the|m, |they |slip o|ver| the |surf|ace o|f the |pr|airies| with |a |speed| equal
|i|f n|ot |s|uper|ior t|o |that of |the |express| tr|ain|s.

|Mr. |Fogg| |re|adily |made a |bar|gain |with t|he |owner| of th|is land|-|craf|t|.
|The w|ind| was fa|vourable|, |b|e|ing |f|resh, |a|nd |blo|wi|ng| |fro|m the w|est.
The |s|now had |h|a|rd|ened|, and |Mud|ge was |very |co|n|fident o|f b|e|ing |ab|le
to |trans|port| |Mr. Fogg| in |a |few |hours to| Omaha|.  The|nce th|e tra|in|s
east|ward r|un| fre|quent|ly| to |Chi|cago| |and |New |Yo|rk|.  |It |was |no|t |i|mpos|sible|
t|hat |the |lo|st time |might |yet be recove|red|; and |such a|n o|ppo|rtun|ity
was no|t |to| b|e |re|jected.

|No|t |wi|sh|ing to |expos|e |Aouda| to the d|iscomforts of tra|vel|ling|
in th|e |open air|, Mr. |Fogg| proposed| t|o |le|ave |her with |Passepartout|
at Fort Kearney|, |the s|erv|ant |tak|ing |up|on |hi|mself to |esc|ort| her|
|t|o Europe b|y |a |better| rou|te| |and un|der| m|ore| |f|avour|able| |con|dit|ions|.
|But| Aouda refused t|o |se|parate |from Mr. Fogg|, and| |Passepartout|
|was |delighted| with h|er d|ecision|; for |not|hing| could i|n|duc|e hi|m
|t|o leave |hi|s |master w|hile| F|ix| |was |with hi|m|.

It w|ould be d|ifficult to |guess t|h|e detective|'s t|hought|s.  |Was |th|is
|conv|iction |sh|ake|n by |P|hileas Fogg|'s| re|turn|, or |did |he |still regard| him|
as a|n exc|eed|ing|ly |sh|r|ewd| r|a|sc|al|, |who|, |h|is |jour|ne|y round |the world |c|ompl|et|ed|,
|would |t|h|ink| him|self |absolutely safe| in England|?  |Perhaps |F|ix|'s o|pin|ion|
of |Phileas Fogg| |was |s|omewhat |mo|difie|d; but| he was |never|thel|ess| |re|solved|
t|o |do |his |dut|y, |and| |to| |hast|en the r|e|turn o|f the wh|ole part|y to| England|
a|s |much| as possible|.

|At |e|ight |o'clock |the |s|l|edge| was r|eady| to |s|tart|.  |The| pa|ssengers|
took |the|ir place|s |on |it, and |w|rapped them|selves| up| cl|osely|
|in |the|ir |tra|vel|l|ing-c|l|oaks|.  The| |two g|r|eat| s|ails| were |ho|isted|,
and |under th|e |p|r|ess|ure |of |the wind| |th|e |sl|edge| |sl|id |over| the |ha|rd|ene|d
|s|now with a ve|locity| of |fort|y| mi|les| |an hour|.|

|The |dis|tance be|tween |For|t Kearney| a|nd |Om|aha|, a|s the b|ird|s |fl|y,|
is a|t most |two |hundred |miles|.  |If the |w|ind h|eld |good,| |the| distance|
|might be| tr|ave|rsed |in |five |hours|; i|f no accident h|app|ened| th|e| s|ledge|
|mig|ht r|e|ach |Omaha| by one| o'clock|.

|W|hat |a |journey|!  |Th|e tra|vellers|, |h|udd|le|d cl|ose| t|ogether|, |co|uld no|t| |spea|k|
for the |col|d, |inten|si|fied| |by the ra|pidit|y |at |which |the|y were| going.|
The |sl|ed|ge s|ped on |as l|ightly a|s a| b|oat| o|ver |the |w|aves|.  |When |the| bre|eze
c|ame s|ki|mming |t|he e|arth| the |sl|ed|ge seemed to |be |li|ft|ed| o|ff t|he |gr|ou|nd
|by |its |sails|.  |Mudge|, who |was |a|t |the r|udd|er|, kept i|n a| st|rai|ght |li|ne,
and by |a |t|urn |of| his |hand| |checked| the| lur|ch|es w|hich| |th|e| ve|h|icle
had |a t|ende|ncy t|o |mak|e|.  A|ll th|e |s|ails| |were up,| and| |the |jib
|was |s|o| |arr|anged| a|s not |to| s|creen| t|he |bri|gantine|.  |A to|p-mast| wa|s h|oisted|,
and anot|her |jib|, he|ld o|ut |to |the w|ind, |add|ed it|s f|orce |to |the other| |sails.
A|l|though the |s|peed c|o|uld not| be| |ex|act|ly e|stimated|, the |sledge| co|uld| not|
be |go|ing |at l|es|s |than |forty| mi|les an hour|.|

|"I|f no|thing b|re|ak|s," |said |Mudge, "|we shall g|et t|here|!"

|Mr. F|ogg| had |made |i|t fo|r |Mud|g|e|'s inte|rest| t|o reach |Omaha|
wi|thin t|he| time| ag|reed |on|, by the of|fer o|f a |handsome |re|ward|.

|Th|e| pr|air|ie|, |a|cross which |the| sledge |was |moving| i|n |a |st|rai|ght|
li|ne, |was a|s |fl|at| as a |s|ea|.  |It |seemed |like |a| va|st |fro|z|en la|ke|.
|The r|ail|road |which| r|a|n |th|rough this |s|ect|ion| a|scend|ed from |th|e|
|so|uth|-|west| |to the |north|-|west| by |Great |Island|, C|olumbus|,|
an| i|mportant |N|ebraska town|, |S|chuyler,| a|nd Fre|mont|, t|o |Omaha|.
|It |followed |th|rough|out the r|ight| bank |of |the |Platte River|.
|The| |sl|edg|e|, |shortening th|is |route, |to|ok a |ch|ord of |t|he| a|rc
de|sc|rib|ed |by the| r|a|il|way|.  |Mudge| was |not |a|fraid| of be|ing st|opped|
by |the| |Platte River|, |because it w|as |fr|o|zen.|  |The road|, |the|n,| was quit|e
c|lear of o|bs|tacles, |and |Phileas Fogg| |had| |but |tw|o th|in|g|s |to |fe|ar|--

|But the |br|eeze|, far |from |lessen|ing |it|s |forc|e, |bl|ew |as |i|f |to|

|"|Th|ose c|hords g|ive| the fifth a|nd |t|he |octa|v|e,|" said |Mr. Fogg|.

|The|se w|ere t|h|e on|ly |w|ord|s| he |u|tt|er|ed |during th|e| j|ourney|.|
|Aouda|, |c|osi|ly p|acked |in| f|ur|s and |cloaks|, was s|he|ltered|
|a|s |much as possible| |from the a|ttacks| o|f the| |freezing wind|.|
A|s f|or |Passepartout|, h|is |f|ace |was |as red |as |the| s|un's d|is|c
w|hen it |se|t|s in |the mist|, |a|nd| |he |lab|or|iously |i|nha|led| the biting| |air|.
|With h|is natural| buoya|ncy of s|p|ir|i|ts|, |h|e |began to |hope |again|.
|Th|e|y |w|ould |re|ach| |New |York| on the |evening|, i|f |not on the |mo|rning|,

|Passepartout| e|ve|n |felt |a| |s|trong |des|ire| |to| |gr|asp| his |ally,| Fix|, b|y the| h|and|.
|He| rem|embered th|at |it |was |th|e |detective| w|ho p|ro|cured| the |s|l|edge|,

|Wh|ile |ea|ch o|f the |pa|rt|y| w|as |ab|sorbed in re|flecti|on|s |so |di|ff|erent|,

The |cre|eks| it |passe|d| o|ver| |were no|t |p|erceived|.  |Fields| and |strea|ms|
d|isappeared under th|e |uni|form |whiteness|.  |The pla|in |was abso|lutely |des|erted.

|About noon |Mudge |perceived| |by |certain| la|ndm|arks t|hat| |he was|

|The |China, |in |le|aving|, se|emed |to have |carried |off| Phileas Fogg|'s|

and |th|e ad|di|tional trip| from |Ha|vre to |Southampton would render| Phileas Fogg|'s|

|Passepartout| was |crushed|; |it o|verwh|elmed hi|m| to lose| the |boat|

Th|e |party c|rossed |the |Hu|dson |in the |Je|rsey |C|ity ferryboa|t,

|whose f|un|n|el|, |p|uffing a clo|ud of |smoke|, i|n|dica|ted th|at| sh|e was| g|et|ting ready|
|for |de|parture|.|

|Phileas Fogg| |ha|iled a b|oat|, |got i|nto it|, and |soon |fou|nd himself| on| board|
|the |Henrietta|, i|ron|-h|ull|ed, w|ood-built |abo|ve|.  |H|e a|s|cended |t|o |the d|eck,|
|and |a|sked| |for the |captain|, |wh|o |forthwith |presen|ted himself|.  |He |was| |a |m|an
o|f |fifty|, a| |sort of s|e|a-|wolf|, wi|th |bi|g e|yes|, |a| |comp|lexion of o|xidised| c|o|pper|,
|red h|air |and |th|ick| nec|k|, |and |a growling |v|oic|e.|

|"|The c|aptain|?" |asked |Mr. Fogg|.

"|I am t|he |c|a|ptain|."

|"I |am |Phileas Fogg|, o|f Lo|ndon|."

|"A|nd |I am |An|dr|ew Speedy|, |of |Cardiff|."

"|You are |going| to pu|t |to |sea|?"

"|In |an| |hour|."

|"|You are bound for|--|"

"|Bordeaux|."

"|And you|r |cargo?"

"No| freight|.  |Goi|ng| |in| b|allast."

"|Have you a|n|y p|assen|ger|s|?|"

|"|No| passengers|.  |Never| |have| p|ass|engers|.  |Too |mu|ch |i|n the |way|."

|"|Is |your |vessel| a| swift one|?"|

"|Between eleven| and |twelve |kn|o|ts|.  |The |Henrietta|, |well k|nown.|"

|"|W|ill you |ca|rry |me |an|d |th|ree other| p|ersons to L|iverpool|?"

"|To| Liverpool|?  |Why| no|t t|o |Ch|i|na|?|"

"|I |said |Liverpool|.|"
|
"|No|!"

"|No|?"

"|No|.|  |I |am s|etting o|ut| for |Bord|eaux|, and| |shall |go| t|o |Bo|rdeaux|."

"|Money| is no object?"

"|No|ne.|"

|The |ca|ptain |s|poke| in| a |tone| wh|ich |did not |a|dm|it |o|f a| reply.
|
|"|But the |owners |of the |Henrietta|--|" re|sumed |Phileas Fogg|.

|"|Th|e| owners a|re |my|self," re|plied the captain|.|  "T|he| vessel |be|lo|ng|s t|o me|."

|"I |will freight| |it| f|or you|.|"

|"|No|.|"

"|I will |b|uy it |of you|."

|"No|."

|Phileas Fogg| did not bet|ray th|e |l|east| d|isapp|ointment|; but| the|
|situation was |a g|r|ave |one|.  |It |w|as |no|t |at |New York| as |a|t |Hong Kong|,
|nor |with the |c|a|ptain| of the |Henrietta| |as |with| the| c|aptain| of the |Tankadere|.
|Up to this |time| mo|ney |had |s|moo|th|ed| |away| e|very |obstacle|.  |Now| mo|ney| |fai|led.|

|Still|, |s|ome| m|eans m|u|st be fou|nd to |cross the |Atlantic |on |a| boat|,
|unless by |ba|lloo|n|--|wh|ich| w|o|uld have |been |venture|some|,|
|be|sid|es |n|ot |b|eing |ca|pable of being |pu|t in pr|actice|.|
|It| seemed t|hat |P|hileas Fogg |had |a|n| id|ea|, |for |he |said to| the cap|tain|,
"|We|ll|, will |you |carry |me |to Bo|rdeau|x|?"

"|No|, |no|t |if |you pa|id| me |t|wo |hundred |do|ll|ars|."

|"|I| |off|er |you |two |thousand|."

|"Ap|iece|?"|

"|A|piece|."

|"And |th|ere| are four |of y|ou|?"

"|Four|."

|Capt|ain |Speedy| b|egan to s|cr|atch| |hi|s h|ead|.|  |The|re| |w|ere |eight thousa|nd |doll|ars|
to |g|ai|n, wi|thout |c|ha|ng|ing |his |r|oute|; for| which |it |was |w|ell |worth con|quering
th|e |r|epugnance he |had f|or| all kinds |of |passengers|.  |Besides, passenger|'s
a|t t|wo thousand| d|ollars| are |no| longe|r |passenger|s|, bu|t v|alu|able| m|erchand|ise.|
|"I st|a|rt| a|t |n|ine o'clock," |said |Captain Speedy|, |simpl|y|.  "|Are you |and your
p|arty r|eady|?"|

"|We w|ill be |on board| |at| nine| o'clock|," |replied, no |less si|mply|, |Mr. |Fogg|.

|It |was |half-past| e|ight|.  |T|o d|is|embark| from |the |H|enrietta|,| jump into a hack,
|hu|rry t|o the |St. |Nicholas, and |ret|urn |with |Aouda|,| Passepartout|, and e|ven
|the| in|se|parable |Fix| was |the| wo|rk of |a b|ri|ef| time|, and w|as |p|erf|orm|ed| by|

|When |Passepartout| heard |what |th|is last |v|oyage| was going |to| co|st,
he |utte|red |a| pro|lo|nge|d |"|Oh|!|" whi|ch| extended |thr|oughout| |his v|ocal| gamut|.
|
|As for |Fix, h|e |sa|id| to him|self| t|hat th|e |Bank| of |England| w|ould |ce|rtainly

|Chapter |X|X|X|II|I

IN WHICH |PHILEAS FOGG| |SHO|WS |HI|MSE|LF E|QU|AL |T|O |TH|E |OCCA|SI|ON
|

|An h|our |after|, |th|e |Hen|rietta p|ass|ed| the l|ighthouse| wh|ich| m|ark|s |the|
|entra|nce| |of the |Hudson|, |tur|n|ed the |point of |San|dy |Hook|, and put |to|
|se|a.|  |Duri|ng the day| she s|kirt|ed| |Long I|sland|, |passed |Fir|e |Island,
|and |d|i|rected |her course r|apidly| ea|stward|.

A|t |noon| the| ne|xt day|, |a| |ma|n m|ounted the| b|r|idge| t|o |as|certain |th|e|
|vessel|'s p|osi|tion|.|  |It |m|ight be t|hought th|at| th|is |was |Captain Speedy|.
|No|t the least| |in| the |w|orld|.  |It was |P|hileas Fogg|, E|s|quire|.
|As for |Captain Speedy|, |he |was| |shut up in |his c|abin| u|n|der |lock| and| |key,|
and |w|as |u|tt|ering |lou|d |cri|es|, w|h|ich s|ign|ified a|n| anger at once| pardonable|
|and |ex|cessi|ve|.

|What had |happened| w|as very |simple.  |P|hileas Fogg| |wished|
to |go| |to |Liverpo|o|l|, |b|ut |the captain| w|ould |not| |carry h|im| t|here.
|Then| |Phileas Fogg had |taken pa|ss|age |for |Bordea|ux|, and|, d|uring|
th|e |th|irty| hours he had |be|en |on board|, |had |so| s|hre|wdly| |managed|
with| |his b|a|nknotes t|hat| |the s|ailors and |s|tokers, wh|o |were |only|
|an occ|a|si|onal| |c|rew|, and |were n|o|t on |the |best |t|erms with |the| ca|ptain|,
w|ent o|ver to |him| in a bo|dy.|  |Th|is |w|as why Phileas Fogg| was |in| |comma|nd
|in|st|ead of| |Ca|ptain Speedy|; |why| th|e |ca|ptain |was a| pr|isoner |in |his c|ab|in|;
and |wh|y|, in |short|, |the |Henrietta| was |di|recting |h|er |cou|rse |t|owards| Liverpool|.
|It was very clear|, |t|o |se|e Mr. Fogg| manag|e t|he |c|raft|, |that he had| |been| |a |sai|lor|.

|How th|e |adve|nture e|nded wi|l|l b|e |seen an|on.  |A|ouda wa|s |a|nxious|, th|ough| she|
|sa|id nothing|.  |A|s for |Passepartout|, |he| th|ought| |Mr. Fogg's| manoe|uvre
|simpl|y gl|orious.  |The c|aptain| had |s|aid |"be|twe|en eleven and |twelve |kn|ots|,"|
a|nd the |Henr|ietta| con|firmed |his |pred|iction|.

|If, then|--for t|he|re were |"ifs" still|--|th|e |sea |did not b|e|come|
to|o boist|erous|, if |the| |wind did not |veer r|o|und |t|o |the |e|ast|,
|if |no| accident |h|app|ened| t|o |th|e |bo|at| o|r |i|ts ma|chinery|, |the |Henrietta|
might |cro|ss the |th|re|e thousand| |miles| from |New Yo|rk| to| |Liverpool|
in th|e| nin|e days, |between t|he |12th| and |the |2|1st of December|.
|I|t |is |true| t|h|at|, once a|r|rive|d, |the |af|fair| |o|n bo|ard| the |Henri|etta|,
added t|o |that of the |Bank of |England|, |might cre|ate |more| di|fficult|ies|
|for |Mr. Fogg| |tha|n |he i|magined| or |co|uld |de|s|ire|.

|During the |first d|ay|s|, |the|y we|nt |alon|g| s|mo|oth|l|y e|nough|.  |The |s|ea wa|s
no|t |very |un|propitious|, the |wi|nd| |s|eemed |stationary |in the| |north|-east|,
|the |sails| were |h|o|isted|, and |the |Henrietta| |pl|ou|ghed |across| the |waves|
|l|ike a |re|al t|rans-Atlantic |s|teamer|.

|Passepartout| |was |deli|ghted|.  H|is |ma|ster|'s l|ast e|x|pl|oi|t|, the c|o|nsequence|s
of which| h|e |ignore|d|, e|ncha|nted hi|m.  |Never| h|ad |the| |c|rew| |seen |s|o |jolly
a|n|d de|xter|o|us |a| fellow.  |He |formed w|arm |friends|hips |with |the |sailors|,
|and |a|ma|zed them with |his |acrob|atic |f|eat|s.|  |He |thought| th|ey |ma|nage|d
t|he| v|essel |like gentlem|en|, and th|at the| |stokers f|ir|ed up| |like |he|ro|es|.
|His |l|oquacious good-|humour |inf|ected |eve|ryone|.  He |had |forgotten the| past|,
i|t|s |ve|xations |and del|ays|.  |He |only t|hought| of |the |e|n|d, so |nearly| |acco|mplished|;
|and |some|ti|mes he |boiled o|ver |with i|mpati|ence|, |a|s if he|a|ted| by |the| |fu|r|nac|e|s|
|of |the |Henrietta|.  |Often|, a|l|so, |the |wor|thy f|ellow r|evolved |a|round| |Fix|,|
|looking a|t hi|m |with| a| |keen|, |di|strustful| eye; but| he |did not| speak| to hi|m|,
|for th|e|ir |old intim|acy no longer| e|xisted|.

|Fix|, i|t must |be |c|on|fess|ed|, |understood| |nothing| of| what was going on|.
The co|n|quest of |the |Hen|r|ietta|, the b|r|ibery of the |c|rew, |Fogg| m|a|nag|ing
the b|oat |like a |ski|l|le|d| seaman|, ama|zed a|nd c|onfused |hi|m|.  |He |did n|ot| kn|ow|
|what to |think|.  |For, |a|fter a|ll|, a| man w|ho |began b|y |stea|ling f|ift|y|-five| thousand|
|pounds| |mi|ght |en|d by |st|eal|ing |a v|essel|; |and| |Fix was |no|t u|n|natural|ly| i|ncl|in|ed
t|o |con|clud|e |that| the| |Henri|etta| under Fogg|'s| c|om|ma|nd|, was no|t |going| to| |Liverpool|
|at a|ll|, |but |to |s|ome |p|art of the |world| w|here| the| |robber|, t|u|rn|ed i|nto |a| |pirate|,
|would |quiet|ly |pu|t hi|ms|elf |in safe|ty.|  The| |co|njecture| was| a|t l|east a pla|usi|ble
|on|e, and the |detective| began to |se|r|ious|ly re|g|ret that| |he |had embarked|
on the| affair|.

As |for |Captain Speedy|, |he |co|ntin|ued| to howl a|n|d growl in his |cabin|;
and |Passepartout|, |w|ho|se |d|uty |it |was |to| |carry hi|m |hi|s m|eals,|
|c|ourageous| as |he was|, |to|ok| |the| gr|eate|st prec|aution|s.|  |Mr. Fogg|
|did not se|em |e|ven |t|o |kn|ow| that the|re| was a| |c|aptain on board|.
|
|On the |13th the|y |pas|sed |the |edg|e o|f |the |Ba|nks |of N|ewfo|undland|,
|a| d|ang|erous lo|cality|; |during th|e w|in|ter, |e|sp|ecially|, |th|ere| are|
f|req|uent| |fogs |an|d |hea|vy |g|ales |of w|ind|.  |Ever| si|n|ce |th|e evening|
be|fore th|e |ba|rometer|, s|uddenly |falli|ng|, |had indicated| |an a|pp|roachi|ng|
ch|ange| |in the a|tm|osphere|; |and during |the night the| temperature va|rie|d,
the |co|ld |beca|me |sh|arp|er|, |and| |the |wind |veer|e|d |to |the |sou|th-east|.|

|Th|is was a |m|is|fortune.|  |Mr. Fogg|, in| order not to |d|e|viate| f|rom| his |c|ou|rse,
|f|urled |his s|ails| and |in|creased |the |for|ce o|f th|e |steam|; but the| |vessel's |speed
|sla|ckened|, o|wing to the s|tate o|f th|e |s|ea|, the |long w|aves of which| broke| a|gainst
|the stern|.  |She pit|ched |violent|ly|, |and |this |re|ta|rded| her |pr|ogress|.
|The |br|eez|e li|ttle b|y |little| s|well|ed| in|to a| |tempest|, |and |it| was |t|o be| f|eared|
t|hat |the |H|enrietta| |might |not be |able to |m|a|int|ain he|rself| upri|ght| o|n| the| |wa|ves|.

|Passepartout|'s vi|sage darke|ned with |th|e s|ki|e|s, |and |for t|wo d|ays the |poor|
fellow| expe|rience|d |co|nst|ant| |fright|.  But |Phileas Fogg| was |a b|old m|a|rin|er|,
|and |k|new h|ow| |to ma|intain he|a|dway| a|gainst| th|e s|ea|; and he |kept on| his| |cou|rse,
|with|out eve|n decr|easing |his stea|m.|  |The| |Henrietta|, |w|hen she could not| r|ise
upon the w|aves|, c|ross|ed them|, s|w|am|ping |he|r| d|eck|, |bu|t p|assing s|afe|ly|.
|Some|ti|nies| the |s|crew rose |out |of |the |wa|ter|, be|ating it|s pro|trudi|ng| end|,
|when |a |mount|ain| of water| r|ais|ed t|h|e |ste|rn abo|ve| the| wa|ves|; |but| th|e |c|raft
always kept |str|aight| ah|ead|.|

The |wind|, |however, |did not |gr|o|w a|s| boisterous| |as |m|ight |have |been| f|ea|red|;
it was |no|t |one of th|ose |tempest|s |which b|ur|st|, |a|nd |rush| o|n |with |a| sp|ee|d
of |nine|ty |miles| an hour|.  |It |co|ntinued| fr|esh|, |but|, |un|happi|ly|, it re|mained
obstinately in the| |south|-ea|st|, r|endering |the| s|ail|s |u|seless|.

|The| |1|6th| of |December| was |the |sevent|y|-fifth da|y |si|nce |P|hileas Fogg|'s|
|d|ep|arture| from |London|, |and| |the| |Henrietta had |not yet b|een| |se|riously| d|el|ayed|.
|Ha|lf| of the |voyage| was |al|most |accomplished|, |and| |t|he wo|rst| localit|ies
|had |b|een |p|ass|ed|.  |In |su|mm|er|, |s|ucce|ss| w|o|uld h|ave| been |well|-n|igh| certain|.
|In| |wi|nt|er|, |they |were a|t| |the |mercy of the| b|ad |sea|s|on|.|  |Passepartout|
|said |n|othing|; but| he |che|rished |ho|pe| in| |se|cret, and |com|forted| h|i|mself
|w|ith the |reflect|ion| that, i|f |the |wind |f|ai|led them|, the|y might| |still|
|cou|nt| o|n |the |s|team|.

|On| th|is day the |en|gineer| came o|n |deck|, |went up| to| |Mr. Fogg|, |and|
|b|egan t|o |spe|ak e|ar|nestly |with hi|m.  |Without knowing| why| i|t |was|
|a |pre|senti|ment|, |perhaps| Passepartout| became |v|agu|ely u|ne|asy.|
He would have |g|iven| |one |of| h|is |ear|s| to| h|ear| wi|th the| |o|ther| w|hat
|the |en|gineer| w|as s|aying.|  |He f|i|nally |ma|naged t|o |ca|tch |a |few wo|rd|s|,
|and |w|as |sure| he| |heard |his |ma|ster| s|ay|, "|You a|re |certain| o|f what| you |t|ell| me|?"

"Certa|in|, |sir|," replied| |the |engineer|.|  |"You must reme|mber th|at|,|
|si|nce |we st|art|ed|, w|e have kept up hot |fires| in all o|u|r f|urn|aces|,
and|, |though| we had |co|a|l enough to g|o |on |short steam| from |New York| to|
|Bordeaux|, |w|e ha|ven't enough to |go with| all |st|eam f|rom |New York| to| Liverpool|."
|"I |will |co|ns|ider|," |re|plied| Mr. Fogg|.
|
|Passepartout| |understo|od |it all|; |he |was |se|ized |with |mor|tal anxi|et|y|.
|The| coal was g|iv|ing out|!  |"Ah, if my master c|a|n |g|et over| tha|t|,"
|muttered |he|, "|he|'ll| be a| |fa|mou|s m|an|!" | He |could| not |help| im|parting|
t|o |Fix |what h|e had over|hea|rd.

|"The|n |you| |bel|ieve tha|t w|e |real|ly| are going| to |Liv|erpool|?"

"|Of course.|"

"|Ass!|" |replied |the detective|, |s|hru|gging his |sh|ou|lders| and |tur|ning| |on |his |heel|.
|
|Passepartout| w|as| on| the |point o|f vi|gorously |re|se|nting th|e| epithet,
the reason of which |he |cou|ld not |for |the| l|ife |of| hi|m c|omprehend|;
b|ut| he reflected |that th|e |unfortunate |Fix was |probably| v|ery| mu|ch|
|disapp|ointed |and h|um|ilia|ted |in |his |se|lf|-es|teem|, a|fter |having s|o|
awkwardly| f|o|llowed |a |fal|se |scent| a|round |the |w|orld|, |and |re|frained.|
|
And now what |co|urse |would |Phileas Fogg| adopt?  |It was |di|fficult|
to |imagine.  |Nevertheless |he seemed| to have| |decided| upon one|,|
for| that eve|ning |h|e |s|ent for |th|e en|gineer|, |and |said| t|o h|im|,
|"|Feed all |th|e| f|ires until |the c|o|al| is e|xhausted."

|A |few |moments |a|fter|, the |fu|nnel of the |Henrietta| v|o|mit|ed |forth t|or|rent|s
o|f s|moke.  The| ves|sel c|ontinued |to |p|roceed |with a|ll |st|eam| on|;
|but |on th|e |1|8th, |the |e|ngineer|, a|s |he had pr|edicted|, |an|nounced|
that |the |co|al| w|ould |gi|ve| out| |in th|e |course| of th|e| |day|.

|"|Do not |let the |fire|s| go |down|," replied| |Mr. Fogg|.
|"|Ke|ep th|em up to th|e l|a|st.  |Let the v|alves |be f|i|lled|.|"

|Towa|rds noon| |Phileas Fogg|, |having |as|certained |the|ir |posit|ion|,|
|called |Passepartout|, |and |ordered| hi|m |to |go f|or |Ca|ptain |Speedy|.
|It was |a|s i|f the| hon|est fellow| had been |c|omm|and|ed to |un|chain a |ti|ger.
|He w|ent |to| th|e |po|op|, |saying| to hi|mself|, "He w|ill |be| li|ke| a |ma|dma|n|!"

|In |a f|ew m|oments|, |with |c|ries and |oaths, |a bomb |app|eared| on the| poop|-d|eck|.|
The |bo|mb |w|as Ca|ptain Speedy|.  |It was clear th|at| he w|as on the |point|
|of |bur|sting|.  |"Wh|ere are |we|?"  were the |first |w|ord|s hi|s |an|ger p|ermitted|
|him t|o utter.  |Had |the| poo|r m|a|n be a|n| apoplectic|, he |could never |have|
|reco|vered from his |p|ar|oxy|sm| of |wrath|.|

"|Wh|ere are we|?" |he |re|p|ea|ted|, w|ith| |pur|ple| |face|.

"|Seve|n |hundred and |seven| miles| from |Liverpool|,"|
replied |Mr. Fogg|, |w|ith| imp|er|tur|bable| cal|mness|.|

|"|Pir|at|e!|"| cried |Cap|tain |Speedy|.

|"|I |have |sent for you, |sir|--"|

|"|Pickaroon|!"
|
"--sir|," continued Mr. |Fogg|,| |"|to ask |you| t|o |se|ll |me your| |vessel."

|"No|!  |By |all |the |devils|, |no|!"|

"|But |I| shall |be o|blig|ed to |b|urn |h|er.|"

|"|Burn |the Henrietta|!"

|"Y|es|; |a|t le|ast| th|e upper |pa|rt of |her|.  |The |co|al ha|s g|iven out|."

"|Bu|rn| my |vessel|!"| cried |Cap|tain Speedy|, |wh|o |co|uld| |s|carcely|
p|ronoun|ce |th|e wor|ds.  "|A vessel w|orth |fi|fty t|housand |do|llars|!"

"|He|re| are |sixty| |thousand," |re|plied |Phileas Fogg|, |h|anding the|
|captain a| r|o|ll o|f |bank|-bills|.  |Th|is had a| prodig|ious |e|ffect|
o|n |Andrew Speedy|.  |A|n American c|a|n| scarcely |re|main un|moved|
|a|t |the |sight of |s|ixt|y| |thousand |doll|ars|.|  |The| c|aptain| |for|got
i|n a|n inst|a|nt h|is |an|ger|, |h|is |imp|r|isonment|, |and |al|l |hi|s g|rud|ges|
|against h|is |pa|ss|enger|.  |The| Henrietta| was |twenty| years old|;
it was a gr|eat ba|rgain|.  |Th|e b|omb w|ould |not| |go of|f af|ter| a|ll|.
|Mr|. Fogg |had| |ta|ken |away |the |m|a|t|ch.|

|"|A|n|d |I| |shall s|t|ill |h|ave the iron hull|," |said |the| |c|aptain| in |a |softer| |ton|e.

|"|The iron| hull| a|nd the engine|.  I|s it a|gree|d?"

|"Agreed|."

And |Andrew |Speedy|, |s|eizing the |banknotes, |cou|nted |the|m|
and |c|on|sign|ed the|m |to his poc|ket|.

|During |th|is co|lloqu|y|, |Passepartout| |was| |a|s whi|te as |a sh|eet|,|
|and |Fix s|eem|ed o|n |the point of |hav|ing |a|n |apoplecti|c |fit.|
|N|early tw|enty| thousand |pounds| had |been |exp|e|n|ded, and |Fogg|
|left |the |h|ull |and |engine| to the |c|aptain|, t|hat is|,|
|n|ear| t|he |whole |v|a|lue| of the| c|raft|!  |It was |t|ru|e|, h|owever,|
t|hat fi|fty|-five |thousand |pounds| had |been |stole|n f|rom the |Bank|.

|W|hen |Andr|ew Speedy| had |pocket|ed| the| |mo|ney|, |Mr. F|ogg |sa|id| to| him|,
"|Don|'t |let |t|h|is as|tonish| you|, |sir|.  |You |must |kn|ow| that| I shall|
|lose |tw|enty| thousand| pounds|, |unl|ess| |I a|rr|ive| in |London| |by|
a |quarter| before nine| on the evening| of the |21st| of December|.
|I| missed th|e |s|teamer| at New York, |and| |as |you |refused| |to take| me |to |Liverpool|--"

"|A|nd |I d|id well|!" cried |Andrew Speedy|; "for I have |ga|ined |at|
least fo|rt|y |thousand| do|llars| b|y |it|!"|  He |added|, more sedately|,|
"|Do you know| on|e| t|hing|, |Captain|--"

"Fogg|."

"|Ca|ptain |Fogg|,| you|'ve got |s|omething o|f |the |Yankee about you|."

|And, |ha|ving p|ai|d h|is passenger| |w|hat |he cons|idered a h|igh |comp|l|i|ment|,
he |was |going |away|, |w|hen |Mr. Fogg| |said|, "|The |vessel now |be|lo|ngs| to me|?"

"Certainly|, fr|om the ke|e|l |to the |t|r|uck| of| |the |m|asts|--|all th|e wood|,| th|at is|."

"|Very well|.  |Have th|e inter|ior |seats|, |bu|n|ks, and fr|ames p|ull|ed d|own|,
|and |bu|rn |the|m|."

|It w|as |n|ecessary| t|o have |dr|y |wood| to |keep| |the| st|eam| u|p
to the |adequa|te |pr|ess|ure|, |and o|n th|at |da|y the| poo|p, |cabins|,|
|bu|nks, |and |the |s|pa|re |d|eck| were |s|acr|ificed|.|  |On th|e ne|xt day|,|
the |1|9th of |December|, |the |masts|, ra|fts|, a|nd |sp|ars |were b|u|rn|ed|;
|the c|rew| worked l|ustily, |keeping up |the |f|ire|s.|  |Passepartout| h|ewed|, cut|,
and |s|awed |away |with| all |hi|s |mi|ght|.  |Th|e|re |was| |a |perfect| r|age| for demolition|.

|The r|ail|ing|s, |fit|ting|s|, |the| gre|at|er| p|art |of the deck|, |and to|p |s|ides|
|dis|appeared on the |2|0th|, |and the |Henrietta |was now only |a| f|lat h|ulk|.
|But |on th|is d|ay |they |sighted the |Iri|sh co|ast| and |Fa|st|net |Li|ght.
|By |ten i|n the |evening t|he|y were passing |Qu|eenstow|n|.  |P|hileas Fogg
|had |on|ly tw|enty|-f|our hours| |mo|re |in |wh|ich t|o |get |to London|;
|th|at length of t|ime| was n|ecessary to |reach |Liverpool|, |with| a|ll steam| |on|.
A|n|d th|e steam |was |abo|ut to |g|ive| |out| al|t|ogether|!

|"Sir|," |said |Captain Speedy|, |who| |was no|w d|eeply in|terested in|
Mr. Fogg|'s |project|, "|I| re|ally| co|mmi|serat|e| you|.  |Everything| is|
a|gainst you|.  |We are o|nly o|p|posite |Queenstown|.|"

|"Ah,|" |said |Mr. Fogg|, |"|is th|at |plac|e |wh|ere we s|ee| th|e l|ight|s| Queenstown|?"

"|Yes|."

"|Can we |enter t|he h|arbour|?"

"|No|t und|er t|hree| hours|.  |Only at |hi|gh tide|.|"

"|Stay|,|" |replied| |Mr. Fogg| c|al|mly|, |without b|e|traying| |in his |feature|s
that by a |s|u|preme i|n|sp|ira|tion| |h|e |was a|bout to| |att|empt| once| mo|r|e|
|to |co|nquer| ill|-|fortune|.

|Qu|ee|nstown| is |the |Iri|sh p|o|rt| |at| |which the tra|ns-|A|tla|ntic |steamer|s|
|stop |t|o put off| |the |m|ails|.  |Th|e|se mails |ar|e |c|arried |to |D|ubl|in|
|by expr|ess |tra|in|s| always |held |in |rea|di|ne|ss| to |s|ta|rt|; |f|rom |Dublin
they a|re |sent| on |t|o |Liverpool| by the |mo|st| |rapid b|oats|,
|and |th|us gain| twe|lve |hours| |on the |Atlantic| |steamer|s|.

|P|hileas Fogg| |co|u|nted |on gain|ing |twe|lve |hours| |in the |sa|me wa|y.|
|Ins|tead of a|rr|iving at |Liverpool the next |eve|ning |by the |Henrietta|,
he |would be |th|ere| b|y |noon|, a|nd |would| |therefore| |have time |to| re|ach |London|
|b|efore |a quarter before |nine| |in the evening|.

|The |Henrietta| entered |Qu|e|enstow|n |Harbo|ur at one o'clock| in the |morning|,
|i|t |the|n be|ing high| t|ide|; |and |Phileas Fogg|, |a|fter |b|eing |gra|sped h|ea|rtily

o|f his |craft|, w|hich| was |s|till |worth| |ha|lf |what he had |sold| |i|t| for|.

|The |part|y went o|n |s|hor|e |at on|ce|.  |Fix| |was gr|eat|ly tempted|
to |arr|est M|r. Fogg| o|n th|e |sp|ot; but| he |did not|.  |W|hy|?  |W|hat |str|uggl|e|
|was |going |on| within| hi|m|?  |Had| he changed |his mi|nd |abo|ut |"h|is ma|n|"?
|Did |he underst|and| t|hat he |had| |made |a |g|r|av|e m|ist|ake|?|  |He| |d|id not|,|

|Phileas Fogg| a|t last| dis|emb|arked| on the |Liverpool| |quay,|

|six| hours |d|is|t|an|t |from |London|.|

|But |at t|h|is| moment| Fix |ca|me |up|, p|ut his |hand| u|pon Mr. Fogg|'s| |shoulder|,

"|I am|."

"|I| |arre|st |you i|n |th|e |Queen's na|me|!"|




|Chapter |XX|XIV
|
|IN WHICH |PHILEAS FOGG| |AT |L|AST |R|EACHE|S L|O|NDON
|
|
|Phileas Fogg| |was |in p|r|ison|.  |He had |been |s|hut up| in |the C|ustom |House|,
and he| w|as t|o h|e t|ra|ns|f|erred |to |London| t|he next day|.

|Passepartout|, wh|en he s|aw |his |master |a|rre|st|ed|, |would |have|
|f|allen upon |Fix ha|d |he| not |been| h|eld| back |by |some p|olicem|en|.
|Aouda |was |th|und|erstruck |at the |s|uddenness| o|f |an| e|ve|nt |whi|ch
|s|he |could not |u|nderstand|.  |Passepartout |ex|pla|ined to her| h|ow|
i|t w|as |th|at the hon|est and |co|urageous| Fogg| |was |ar|rest|ed| a|s |a r|obber|.
|The| young woman|'s |h|ear|t r|e|vol|ted |against| |so |he|in|ous| a| charge|,
|and |wh|en |she s|aw |that |she could |attempt| to |do| not|hing| to |s|ave|
h|er pr|otector|, |she |w|ept bi|tterly|.|

|As for |Fix|, |he had |a|rrested| |Mr. Fogg| be|cause it was |h|is |duty,|
|whe|ther |Mr. Fogg| |were guil|ty o|r n|ot|.

|The |th|ought th|e|n s|tr|uck |Passepartout|, |th|at |he |was| the c|a|use of th|is
n|ew |misfortune|!  H|ad h|e |not |co|ncealed |Fix|'s| e|rrand| f|rom |his |master|?
|Wh|en |Fix r|evealed hi|s |true| cha|racter| a|nd |p|urpos|e|, |w|hy |h|ad he |not t|old|
|Mr. Fogg|?  |If |the lat|te|r had |been |w|arned, he w|ould |n|o| doubt| |h|ave given|
|Fix| p|roof of his |inn|ocence|, |and| |s|atisfied h|im| o|f his |mistake|; a|t least|,
Fix would |no|t |have |co|ntinued| his journ|ey| |a|t |th|e |ex|pense and |o|n |the |heel|s
|of| |his ma|ster|, |on|ly |to arr|est |him t|he |moment| |he| |s|et foot o|n |En|gl|ish| s|oil|.
|Passepartout| w|ept |ti|ll |he was b|li|nd|, and |fel|t l|ike bl|owi|ng| hi|s |brai|n|s out.

|Aouda a|nd |he| had |remained|, |desp|ite |the c|o|ld, |under t|he |po|rt|i|co|
of |th|e |Cu|sto|m House|.  |Neithe|r w|ished to leave |th|e p|la|ce|;|
b|oth were a|nxi|ous to| see |Mr. Fogg| |again|.

|Tha|t gentleman |was |re|ally ruin|ed, |and |th|at |at |the moment|
w|hen |he |was a|bout to |att|ain| |hi|s |end.|  |Th|is arrest| w|as fatal|.
|H|a|ving a|rr|ived |at |Liverpool |at |t|wenty| mi|nutes |before|
t|we|lve| o|n the |21st of |December|, |he h|ad t|ill a |qu|arte|r before| nine|
that evening t|o re|ach the |Reform |Club|, |that is,| nine |hours| |and a| |quarter|;
|the| journey from |Liverpool to |London| |was |six |hours|.

|If |an|yo|ne, |a|t |th|is| moment|, |had |e|ntered |the| |Custom |Ho|u|se|,
|he w|ould |have |f|o|und |Mr. Fogg| s|e|ated|, mo|tionle|ss, cal|m, |and without|
a|pp|arent |an|ger|, u|pon a| w|o|oden| be|nc|h.  H|e |was| no|t|, it is |true,|
r|esigned|; |but th|is |l|ast blow| f|a|il|ed to |force| |him |in|to |an outward
|betrayal of a|ny e|motion|.|  |Was he b|e|ing |d|evo|ured by on|e o|f th|ose|
secret| r|ag|es|, |a|ll| t|he| |more |terri|ble |because c|ont|ained|, |and w|hich
|o|n|ly |bu|rst |fort|h|, |with a|n |i|rresistibl|e force|, a|t the| |last moment|?
No| one| co|uld t|ell.  There| he |sa|t, |ca|lmly wa|iting--fo|r wh|at|?
|Did he s|t|ill |cherish hope?  D|id he |still| be|l|ieve,| now |th|at the| door
of th|is |prison| was |c|l|osed upon |hi|m|, |th|at he |would |s|ucc|eed|?

However t|hat |m|ay |hav|e been|, Mr. Fogg| ca|re|fully p|ut |his |wa|tch
|u|pon |the| t|able|, and o|bs|erv|ed| |i|ts |advan|c|ing |ha|nd|s|.  |Not a |wo|rd|
|escaped hi|s li|ps|, b|ut h|is |look| was |si|ngula|rly |set| |an|d s|ter|n.
|The| s|i|t|uation|, in |an|y |e|vent|,| |was a |terrible on|e, |and |m|ight be
thus |stat|ed|: i|f |Phileas Fogg| was |hone|st he| was r|uined|; i|f he|
was a k|nave|, he |was |caught|.|

|D|id |escape |o|ccur t|o him|?  |D|id he examine| to see| i|f |there| were|
|any pr|acticable |o|utl|et from |his p|rison|?  Di|d he th|ink| of e|scaping
|from it?  |Poss|ibl|y; |for o|nce| h|e |wal|ked |s|lowly a|round |the |r|oom|.
|But |the| d|oor| w|as |lo|ck|ed|, and |t|he |wind|ow| heav|ily |ba|rred w|ith|
|iro|n r|o|ds.  |He |sat| down |again|,| and |dre|w |hi|s |journ|al| fr|om h|is |p|ocket|.
|On the l|i|ne where the|se wor|ds were| |writte|n|, |"|21st |De|cem|ber|,
|Saturday|, |Liverpoo|l|," he added, |"|80t|h |day|, |11.|40 a.m.|,"| a|nd w|aited.

The |C|ustom |House clo|ck| struck one.  |Mr. Fogg |observed| that |his watch|
|was two| ho|urs| to|o |fa|st|.|

|Two h|ou|rs|!  Ad|mi|tting t|h|at |he |was |a|t th|is moment| t|aking| a|n|
e|xpress train|, he |co|uld |re|ach |London| a|nd| the |Reform| Club|
|by a |quarter| before nine|, p.m|.  |His |foreh|ead| |sl|ightly w|ri|n|kled|.
|
A|t th|irt|y-t|hree mi|nutes |past |two h|e h|eard| a| s|i|ngular noise| o|ut|side|,
the|n |a h|a|sty o|p|ening o|f d|oors.|  |P|assepartout|'s |v|oice was a|u|dible|,
and i|m|me|diately af|ter th|at of |Fix|.  |P|hil|eas Fogg|'s| |eyes| b|ri|ghtened
|for |a|n instant|.

|The| |door| swung open, |and |h|e |saw |Passepartout|, |Aouda|,| and |Fix,|
|who| h|urri|ed t|o|wards |him|.

|Fix |was |o|ut of |breath|, and |hi|s hair was |in d|is|order|.  |He |c|ould no|t s|peak|.
"|S|ir,|" he |stamme|red, "s|ir--forgi|ve |me|--mos|t--| u|nfortun|ate| |re|sembl|ance|--
ro|bber a|rrest|e|d| thre|e days |ago|--you ar|e |fr|ee|!"

|Phileas Fogg| was |fr|ee|!  |He wa|lk|ed |to |the detective|, l|ooked |hi|m |st|eadily
in the| face|, and |with th|e |o|nly ra|pid mo|tion| he had |ever |made i|n his |life|,
or w|hich he |eve|r |would m|ake|, |drew |back his |a|rms|, |and |w|ith| the |pre|cis|ion|
of |a |mach|i|ne k|nock|ed |Fix |down|.
|
|"W|ell| h|it|!" |cried |Passepartout|, |"|Pa|rbleu|! |th|at|'s |what|
|you mi|ght c|all| a| |good| app|l|icat|ion| of |English| |fists|!"

|Fix, w|ho| |fo|und |hi|mself on| |the f|loor|, |did not |utter| a| |word.|
|He |had only |re|c|eived his |des|erts|.  |Mr. Fogg|, Aouda,| and Passepartout|
|left th|e |Custom |House| |with|out |delay, go|t in|to |a |c|ab, an|d |in a| f|ew|
|moments d|es|cended |at |the| |station|.

|Phileas Fogg| |asked i|f the|re| |was a|n |ex|pre|ss t|rain|
|ab|out t|o |leave for |London.|  |It |was |for|ty mi|nutes| past |two|.
|The e|xpress tra|in| had |left |th|irty|-f|ive minutes |before|.
|Phileas Fogg| t|he|n |order|ed a| special |tr|ain|.

|Th|ere| w|ere |se|veral rapid| locomotive|s |on |h|and|; |but |the |railwa|y arrange|ment|s
did not |per|mit t|he| special t|r|ain| to |leave| until |th|ree |o'clock|.
|
|A|t that |hour |Phileas Fogg|, |having sti|mulated |the| e|ngineer| by|
|the o|ff|er o|f a| g|enerous |reward|, |at |l|ast| |se|t |out| |tow|ards London|

|It was n|ece|ssary| t|o |make| the |journey |in |f|ive hour|s |and a ha|lf|;|
|and| th|is would |have |been |eas|y on |a |clear |ro|ad |through|out|.
|But the|re |were for|ced |de|lays|, |and| |when |Mr. Fogg| |s|tepped|
|from the |train| at| |th|e |termin|us|, |all| the| c|locks |in |London|
|w|ere s|t|riking t|en min|utes| before| |nine|."

|H|aving made the t|our of the |wor|ld|, h|e was |b|ehind|-hand|

Chapter |X|X|XV

IN WHICH |PHILEAS FOGG| |DOES N|OT |HAVE| |TO|
|REP|E|AT| HIS |O|RDER|S| T|O |P|ASSE|PART|OUT| T|WI|CE

|
|The d|w|ellers in Saville Row| w|ould have |been |sur|pr|ised |the |n|ext |day|,
|if the|y had |been t|old that |Phileas Fogg| |had |re|turned| |ho|me|.
|His d|oors and w|indows| |w|ere |s|till |c|l|o|sed|, |no| ap|pear|ance o|f |cha|nge| |w|as v|isible|.

|After |lea|ving |the |st|ation|, |Mr. Fogg| gave |Passepartout| i|nstructions
t|o |purchase |s|ome |pr|ov|isions|, |and |quietly |went to hi|s d|omic|ile|.
|
|He |b|ore |his m|isf|ortune| w|ith |hi|s |h|abitua|l t|ranquil|li|ty.|
|R|uined|!  |A|nd |by |the |bl|unde|ring of the| |detective|!  |A|fter h|aving|
s|tea|dily t|ra|versed |th|at l|o|ng| jo|ur|ney|, o|verco|me |a| h|undred| o|bstacles|,|
|br|a|ved |ma|ny d|angers|, and |s|till |found |time| |to |do| so|me g|oo|d on| his |way|,
t|o f|ail |near |the goal |by a |sud|den |event w|hich| he |could not |have| f|ore|seen,|
|and |against which |he |was un|a|r|med|; |it |was |t|errible|!|  |But| a| few pou|nds| w|ere|
l|eft o|f| the l|arge |s|um he had |c|arried |with |hi|m.  |The|re| o|nly| rema|ined
|o|f |his |for|t|une |th|e |twenty| thousand |pounds| deposited| a|t |Barings|,
|a|nd |th|is |amount he o|wed |to |his |fr|iend|s| of the |Reform| Club|.
|So g|reat |h|a|d been t|he e|xpense of his |tour| that, e|ve|n |had |he won|,
|it w|ould |not |have e|nr|iched| |hi|m; and| it |is| pr|obable that |he |ha|d no|t sough|t
|to e|nr|ich hi|m|self|, |b|eing |a |ma|n w|ho| |r|ather| laid w|agers| f|or| hon|our|'s s|ake|
|tha|n for| the |stake| p|ro|p|os|ed|.  |But| th|is w|ager |to|tally ruin|ed| him.
|
|Mr. Fogg|'s c|o|urse|, |however, |was |fu|lly de|cided |upon|; he |knew what| re|mained
for |him t|o |do|.|

|A room |in th|e |ho|use |in| Saville Row| was |set |apart| |for |Aouda,|
|who |was |o|verw|helm|ed |with |gr|ief| |at |her| prot|ector|'s |mis|fortune|.
|From the |w|ords w|hich |Mr. Fogg |dropp|ed|, |sh|e s|aw that |he| was|
|meditat|ing s|ome ser|ious |pro|ject|.

Kn|owing that |English|m|en governe|d by a |f|ixed idea| s|ometimes re|sort
|to |the d|e|sp|erate e|xpedi|ent |of |su|ic|ide, Passepartout |kept a n|a|rrow| wa|tch
|upon |his m|aster|, |th|ough he |care|fully |c|on|cealed| |th|e |app|ear|ance| of |s|o |do|ing.

|Fir|st o|f |all|, |the| |worthy f|ellow |had |gon|e up |to |hi|s |room,| and |h|ad e|xtinguished|
the gas |burn|er|, |which had |been b|urn|ing |for eighty| days|.  |He |had |found|
in th|e |le|tter|-box |a |bill| from th|e gas com|pany|, |a|nd| |he |thought| it| mo|re|
than |t|ime to p|ut |a s|top t|o |th|is |expens|e|, |wh|ich |he |had |been |doom|e|d to| b|ea|r.
|
|Th|e n|ight passed|.  |Mr. Fogg| went |to |be|d|, b|ut |d|i|d |he |sl|eep|?
|Aouda did not |on|ce |c|lose |he|r |eyes|.  |Passepartout| w|atched|
a|ll |night|, |like a |f|ai|thful |dog, |a|t |h|is m|aster's| door|.

|Mr. Fogg| c|a|lled |hi|m |in| th|e |mo|rning|, |and |t|o|ld hi|m| to get||
Aouda|'s |breakfast|, and |a| c|up of t|ea an|d a |cho|p for |himself|.
|He d|esired |Aouda| to |excuse him| f|rom b|reakfast| and d|i|nner|,
as |h|is time| w|ould be |ab|sorbed |all d|ay| in |putting |his |affairs |to r|ight|s|.
|I|n the |e|vening| |h|e |would |a|sk perm|i|ssion| to have| |a |f|ew |moment|'s|
|conversa|tion| with| |th|e |young| lady.|

|Passepartout|, |having r|e|ceived |his |orders, had |not|hing| to d|o| |but| obey| |t|he|m|.
|He |l|ooked |at| |his |i|mp|erturbable m|a|ster|, |and c|ould| |sc|arcely |bring| h|i|s m|ind|

|for| |he acc|used |h|imself |more |bitterly| tha|n e|ver of being| |the| c|au|se
of |the |irret|r|ie|vable |di|sa|ster.|  |Yes|! i|f he| |had warned| Mr. Fogg|,

|
|P|assepartout c|o|uld |h|old |in |no |longer|.
|
|"My |ma|ster|!  Mr. Fogg|!" he c|ried, "why do| |you not cur|se| me|?
|I|t was m|y f|ault| th|at|--"

"|I b|lam|e no on|e," re|turned |Phileas Fogg|, |w|ith| p|erfect calmne|ss|.|  "|Go|!"

|P|assepartout| l|eft the |room|, and |went |to |fin|d |Aouda|,
|to |wh|om he de|livered his master|'s m|essage|.

|"|Mad|am," he| added|, "|I |can| d|o nothing| my|self|--|nothing|!
|I ha|ve |no i|nf|luence |over| m|y master|;| but| you|, |perhaps|--"

|"|What| influence |co|uld I have|?"| replied |Aouda.|  |"Mr. Fogg|
|is |in|fluenced| by n|o one|.  H|as he eve|r understood |t|hat |m|y gr|at|itude|

|he must not |be |l|eft |a|lone| a|n |instant|!  |You |s|ay he |is going| to|

|"|Ye|s|, m|adam|; |probably| t|o |arrange for you|r |pro|tection| a|nd c|omfort| in |Engla|nd|.|"
|
"|W|e shall s|ee|," replied |Aouda|, |beco|ming |su|dden|ly p|ensi|ve.

|Thro|ughout th|is d|ay |(Sunday|) |the| |hou|se i|n |Saville Row| was |as if uninhabited|,
|and |P|hileas Fogg|, |for |th|e| first| time |si|nce| he |had |li|ved in th|at |hou|se|,
did not |se|t |out |for| |his |cl|ub whe|n |W|estm|inster c|lock| s|t|ruck| |half|-p|ast |eleve|n|.|

|Wh|y s|ho|uld |he pre|sen|t |hi|mself |at |the |Reform|?  His |friend|s| no| longer |expect|ed|
|him t|he|re|.  |As |Phileas Fogg |had |not |a|ppeared| in |the |saloon| on |the|
|eve|n|ing| be|fore| |(Sa|turday, |the |21|st of |December|, at a quarter| before| nine|),
h|e had l|ost his wager.|  I|t was |no|t eve|n |necess|ary| t|hat he should |go| t|o||
hi|s ba|nk|ers f|or |the |twenty| thousand pounds|; |for |his antagonis|ts| a|lready
|had |hi|s c|heque| in| |the|ir h|and|s, |and t|he|y |had only| to |fi|ll| it |ou|t|
|and |sen|d |it t|o |the |Ba|rings| |to |ha|ve the |a|m|ount| t|ransfer|red to |their |c|re|dit|.
|
Mr. Fogg|, |th|erefore|, ha|d no r|easo|n for going |out|, |and| so|
|he re|mained |a|t |home|.|  |He shut hi|mself| up in| his |room,|
and |busie|d hi|mself| p|ut|ting |his |affairs |in order.
|Passepartout| c|on|t|inu|ally |as|cend|ed a|nd |des|cend|ed the |st|airs.
|Th|e |hour|s |we|re |l|o|ng |f|or him|. |He l|is|tened| |at h|is |master|'s d|oor|,
|and l|ooked |th|rough| |the ke|yh|ole|, a|s if |he |had a| |perfect right| so| |t|o |d|o,
|and |as| if h|e |f|ea|red that |s|omething| terr|ible| |might h|appen |at| an|y mome|nt.
|Sometimes| he |th|ought| of |Fix|, |but no| |longer| in a|ng|er|.  |Fix|, |like a|ll|
the wo|rld|, |had |been |mistaken| in |Phileas Fogg|, |and h|ad |on|ly |done hi|s |duty|
in tra|cking |and |a|rre|st|ing| him|; |while |he|, |Pass|epartout|. . .| .|
|Th|is |thought |haunted hi|m|, |and |he |never c|eased |cur|sing| |his m|iser|able| fo|lly|.
|
|Fi|nding himself |to|o |wre|tched |to re|main |a|lone|, h|e |knocked |at |Aouda|'s |do|or|,
|went into her room|, |se|ated |him|self|, without |sp|eaking|, |in |a |corner|,
|and |lo|ok|ed |ru|eful|ly |at |th|e young woman|. Aouda |was st|il|l pensive|.

|About |half|-past| |seve|n |in |the evening| Mr. Fogg| |se|nt to |k|now|
|i|f |Aouda |w|ould re|ceive h|im|, |a|nd |in |a f|ew |mo|ments| he| |found |himself|
alone with |h|er.|

|P|hileas Fogg |took |a |ch|air, a|nd| sat down near| |the |fireplac|e|,|
opposite |Aou|da|.  |No| e|motion| wa|s v|isi|ble on |his |face|.
|Fogg| returned |was |ex|actly t|h|e |Fogg| w|ho had |gone away|;|
|the|re| w|as |the s|ame ca|lm, the |same |impassib|ility.

|He |sat se|veral| m|inutes| with|out |s|peaking|; |the|n, be|ndi|ng his |eyes| on |Aouda,|
|"|Madam,|" |said |he|, "|w|ill you |pardon| me for| bringing |you to |Engla|nd|?"

"|I|, |Mr. |Fogg|!"| replied |Aouda|, c|h|ecking th|e pulsati|ons of he|r hea|rt|.
|
"|Pl|ease| l|e|t me| finish|," re|turned |Mr. Fogg|.|  |"|When I d|ecided to
|b|ring| you |f|ar |away from the c|o|unt|ry| |which |was |s|o |un|safe| for you|,
I| was |ri|ch|, and |co|unted on |put|ting |a| |po|rtion| |of my |fort|une|
at your dis|posal|; |the|n| your |e|xiste|nce| would have| been |f|ree a|nd h|appy|.
|But no|w I am |r|uin|ed.|"

"|I| kn|ow| it|, Mr. |Fogg|," |re|plied |Aouda|; "|an|d I ask |you |in |my turn,|

"|M|adam, you| c|ould not |re|main in |India,| a|n|d your| sa|fe|t|y co|uld|

"|As |for |m|e, m|adam|,|" |replied |the |gen|tl|em|an|, co|ld|ly|, "I |have |n|eed o|f| nothing|."

|"But| |how do you l|ook upon |th|e |fate, |sir|,| which |awa|its you|?"

"|As |I |am in |th|e |habit o|f |do|ing|."

"|At |least|,|" said |Aouda|, |"want should |not overtake| a |man| like| you|.|

|Mr. F|ogg|, a|t th|is|, ro|se in his |turn|.|  |The|re| was |a|n unwonted

"|I |lo|ve you|!"| he sa|id|, |si|mpl|y.  "Y|es|, by |all that| |is |h|olie|st|,

"Ah|!" |cried |Aouda|, pre|ssing| his hand| to |her h|ea|rt.

|IN WHICH |PHILE|AS FOGG|'S |NA|ME IS |ON|CE |M|ORE| |AT A |P|R|EMIUM| O|N| 'CHAN|GE|


|It is |t|ime to |re|late |wh|at a| c|hange t|ook |p|lace |in |En|glish|
p|ublic op|inion| |wh|en| |it| tr|a|nspired |th|at the| |real| bank|rob|ber|,|
a| certain |James |Str|and|, h|ad been a|rrested|, on the| |17th day of |December|,
|at |Edinburgh.|  |Th|ree days before|, |Phileas Fogg| |had |been| a| criminal|,
w|h|o |was |be|ing |de|sperately |fo|llowed |up| by| the |p|olice|; no|w |he |was |an
ho|no|urable gentleman|, |mathematically p|ursuing |his |e|cc|entric |jo|urney
r|ou|nd |the w|orld|.|
|
|The |p|apers re|sumed the|ir |di|s|cussion| about the |w|ager|; al|l those|
|who |had |laid |bet|s|, fo|r |or |again|st |him|, re|vi|ved the|ir |i|nter|e|st|,
|as if by ma|gi|c; the| "|Phileas Fogg| bond|s" |again| became negotiable|,
|and |ma|ny ne|w w|agers| were m|ade|.  |Phileas Fogg|'s| name |was |on|ce more|
at |a pre|mium| on| 'Change|.

|His fi|ve f|riends |of| the |R|eform| Club| passed th|ese |three| days |in|
a |state |o|f fe|verish sus|pe|nse.|  |W|ould Phileas Fogg|, who|m th|e|y ha|d
forgot|ten|, |reappear |be|fore| t|he|ir eyes|!  |Where |wa|s |he at| this m|oment|?
|Th|e| 1|7th of |December|, the |d|ay of |Jame|s Str|a|nd|'s arrest|,
was |the |s|eventy|-|si|xt|h s|i|nce |P|hileas Fogg|'s| |departure|,
|and| no| ne|ws| |of h|im |had been| re|c|eived.  Was he |dead|?
|Ha|d |he |ab|andoned th|e |effort|, |or was h|e con|tinui|ng| hi|s |jour|n|ey|
|al|ong the |route| a|greed upon|?  |An|d |would| he| |appe|ar |on |Sa|turday|,|
the| |2|1|st of |December|, at a quarter| before| nine| in the evening|,
|on the |th|re|shold o|f the| |Reform| Club| sal|oo|n|?

|The an|xiety |in which|, |for| |th|re|e days|, L|on|don |s|oci|ety e|xisted|,
c|a|nnot be d|esc|ribed|.|  |T|ele|gra|ms| were |se|nt to |America| a|nd |Asia
for| new|s |of |Phileas Fogg|.  |Messengers| were |dispatched to| |the |h|ou|se
|in| |Saville Row| m|orning| a|nd evening|.  |No| ne|ws.|  |The |police |were|
|ignora|nt wh|at had become| of the |detective|, |Fix|, |who |had s|o
unfortun|ately |fo|llowed |up a| |f|alse |scent|.  |Be|ts inc|r|eased|,|
|never|theless, |in n|um|ber| a|nd |value|.|  |Phileas Fogg|, |like a|
|racehorse, |was |d|raw|ing |near| hi|s l|ast| tur|ning|-point|.  The| b|o|nds
we|re qu|ot|ed, |no| longer| |at |a hundred b|elow |par,| |but |at |t|wenty|,|
a|t t|en|, |and a|t |five|; and |par|al|ytic |o|ld Lord| Al|bema|rle |bet e|ven|
in hi|s favour|.|
|
|A gr|eat| cr|owd| was collected| in| |Pa|ll Mall a|nd| the nei|ghbou|ri|ng
stree|ts on Saturday| e|ve|ning|; it seemed |like |a |multitude| of| b|r|oker|s
p|erm|an|e|ntly |e|st|abl|ished |around |the |Re|form Club|.|  |C|irculation|
|was |impede|d, and e|ve|ry|where| d|is|putes, d|is|cussion|s|, |and fi|nancial
|tra|nsa|cti|on|s w|ere |going| on|.  Th|e| |police| had g|reat| difficulty in|
keeping back |the c|rowd|, and |a|s the |hou|r w|h|en |Phileas Fogg|
|was |due| a|pproach|ed, |the |ex|c|ite|m|ent |r|ose to |its highest p|it|ch|.|

|The five |antagonists| |of Phileas Fogg| |had| |met |in| the gr|eat s|aloon o|f the |club|.
|John |Sulliva|n and Samuel |Fallen|tin|, |the| b|an|kers|, A|ndrew |Stuart|, th|e engineer|,
Gauthier Ralph|, the d|i|rector of |the |Ba|nk o|f |England|, |and |Thomas Flanagan|,|
t|he| br|ewe|r, o|n|e |a|nd a|ll w|aited |a|nxious|ly|.

|W|h|en |the |cl|ock| indicated t|wenty| mi|nutes| |pas|t |eight|, |Andrew |Stuart| |go|t up|,
saying|, "G|entlemen|, in t|wenty| minutes |t|he| t|ime a|greed |upon| b|etween| |Mr. Fo|g|g|
and| |o|ur|se|lves| |wi|ll h|ave |exp|ire|d|."

|"W|hat| |time |did t|he |last t|rain| a|rr|ive| from |Liverpool|?"  asked |Tho|mas Flanagan|.

|"A|t |t|wenty-three minutes past |seven|," |re|plied |Gauthi|er Ralph;|
"and the next does n|ot a|rr|ive| t|ill| ten| mi|n|utes |after t|welve|."

|"Well|, |gentlemen|," |re|sumed |Andrew S|tuart|, |"|if |Phileas Fogg|
had com|e |in| the| |7:2|3 t|rain, h|e w|ould have| g|ot he|re |b|y |th|is |time|.
|We can, |therefore|, |regard| the |be|t as w|on.|"

"|W|ait|; |don't let u|s |be |too ha|sty," replied |Sam|uel| |Fallentin.
|"|You |kn|ow| th|at| Mr. Fogg| |is |very eccentr|ic|.|  |His punctual|ity|
|is we|ll |known|; |he |never a|rr|ives| too s|o|on|,| or too l|ate|; |and| |I
s|hould |not be| s|urprise|d i|f |he |app|eared b|efore |us at the| l|ast m|in|ute|."

|"|Why,|" said |A|ndrew S|tuart| nervou|sly|, |"i|f |I |sh|ould see h|im|,
|I |should |not believe i|t| w|as |he|.|"

|"The| fact |i|s," re|s|umed |Thomas Flanagan|, "|M|r. Fogg|'s| pro|ject|
w|as |abs|urdly f|ool|i|sh|.  W|hat|ever his |pu|n|ctu|ali|ty|, |he| |could no|t|
|prevent the |delays which |were |certain| to |oc|cur|; and |a| delay|
o|f |on|ly |tw|o |o|r |thr|e|e days| would |be |fa|tal to |h|is |to|ur|."

|"Obs|erv|e|, |too|,|" add|ed |John |Sullivan|, "|that w|e have |re|ceived| no|
in|te|lligence| from |him|, |though |the|re| are| t|elegraphic li|nes all|
|al|ong |is r|oute|."

"He |has l|ost|, g|entlema|n," said |Andrew Stuart|, "|he has |a h|undred |time|s lost|!
|You |know|, |be|sides|, |that |the| |China| th|e only |steamer |he |co|uld |ha|ve |take|n
|f|rom |New |York |to |get h|er|e in |t|ime| a|r|riv|e|d| y|ester|day|.|  |I ha|ve |s|een |a| list|
of t|he |p|assengers|, a|nd| |the |na|me of Phileas Fogg| i|s |not a|mong the|m.
|Eve|n |if we |admit| th|at for|tune| |ha|s fa|voured him|, |he |can |sc|ar|cely|
|ha|ve |rea|ched A|merica|.  |I think he w|ill |be at least |twenty| days be|hind-hand|,
and that |Lord| Al|bemarle| w|ill lose| |a |co|ol |fi|ve |thousand|."

"It is |clear|," replied |Gauthier Ralph|; "and |we have no|thing to| |do|
but to |p|re|sent Mr. Fogg|'s c|heque a|t |Bari|ngs to|-morrow|."

|A|t |th|is moment|, |the h|and|s |o|f the |cl|ub| |c|lock po|int|ed|
to t|wenty| mi|nutes |to nine|.

|"|Five| mi|nutes more|," said |Andrew S|tuart|.

The| |five |g|entlem|en |l|ooked |at e|ach other|.  |Th|e|ir anxiety was bec|oming| inte|nse;
|but|, |no|t wishing to |be|tray |it|, t|he|y r|e|adily as|sented |to |Mr. F|allentin|'s|
pro|po|sal| o|f |a r|u|bber|.|

|"I| |would|n't give up| my |four thousand| of the |bet," said |A|ndrew Stuart|,
|as he t|ook h|is |s|eat|, |"for |th|ree| |thousand |ni|ne hundred and |nine|ty-nine|."|

|The c|lock |indicated |eighteen mi|nutes to nine|.

|The player|s t|ook up |the|ir |c|ar|ds, |but| |c|ould not |keep the|ir e|ye|s|
|off the| c|lo|ck|.|  |Certain|ly|, |h|owever| |se|cure| th|ey |f|elt|,|
m|i|nutes h|ad n|ever |se|emed |so| l|ong to t|he|m|!
|
|"S|eve|nteen minutes |to n|ine|," |said |Tho|mas |Flanagan|, |as h|e |c|ut |the |c|ards|
w|h|ich |Ralph| ha|nded to |hi|m.|

|Then the|re| |was a |m|o|ment| |of s|il|ence|.  |The| |gr|eat s|aloon |w|as per|fect|ly quiet|;| but
the |murmur|s of |the |c|r|owd |outside| |were| h|eard|, |with now |a|nd |th|en a| |shri|ll cry|.|
|Th|e |pe|ndul|um bea|t the s|econds|, |which e|ach p|l|ayer e|agerly| |cou|nte|d|,
a|s he |l|istened|, with |ma|thematical| regula|rity|.

|"S|i|xtee|n mi|nutes |to n|ine|!" |said |John |Sullivan|,| |in a v|oice |which |b|etray|ed|
hi|s |emotion|.|

|One minute |mor|e|, and th|e |wager w|ould |be |won|.  |A|n|drew S|tuart|
an|d his |p|art|ners| |su|spended |the|ir| g|ame|.|  |The|y |l|eft t|he|ir |car|ds|,|
|and co|u|nted the| |second|s|.|

|At |the f|ort|ieth| second|, |n|ot|hing|.  |At the f|ift|ieth|, |st|ill nothing.

|At |th|e fi|ft|y-|fi|fth|, a| l|oud cry w|as he|ard| in |the |str|eet|,|
|fo|llowed| by |app|lause|, |h|urrahs|, and s|ome |fier|ce| g|rowl|s.

|The| players |r|ose f|rom their |se|ats|.

|At t|he |fi|ft|y|-seven|th| se|cond |the |door| of |the s|aloon opened|;
|and| |the |pe|ndulum had n|ot |beat the s|ixt|ieth s|econd| w|he|n|

Passepartout| w|ent |on |his |e|rrand |encha|n|ted|.  |He |s|oon
|re|ach|ed |the |clergyman|'s house, but found |him| not a|t hom|e|.
|P|assepartout| w|a|ited |a |good |twen|ty| mi|nutes|, |and wh|en| h|e left|
the| |rever|end g|entlem|an|, it |was t|hirty|-|five minutes| |past |eight|.
|But| i|n what a |st|ate| h|e w|as|!  |With| his |h|air in| dis|order|,
and |without his |ha|t, h|e |r|an |along the |st|reet| |as |ne|ver m|a|n
|w|as |se|en |to |r|un| |before|, |o|vert|urn|ing |pass|ers|-by|,
r|ush|ing o|ver| |the |sidewalk like a w|atersp|out|.

I|n t|h|ree mi|nute|s he |was in |Saville Row| |again,|
an|d st|a|gger|ed |back| in|to |Mr. Fogg|'s r|oom|.

|He |co|uld not s|peak.
|
|"|What| is the m|a|tter|?" asked |Mr. Fogg|.

|"|My |ma|ster|!"| gasped |Passepartout|--"m|arri|age|--im|poss|ible--|"

"|I|mpossible|?"

"|Imp|os|sib|le|--|for| t|o-morrow|."

|"|Why s|o|?|"

|"|Because |to-morr|ow--|is| Su|nday|!"

|"Monday|," |replied| |Mr.| Fogg|.
|
|"|No|--to|-day| is| |Sa|turday|."|

|"S|atur|day|?|  |Impossible|!"

"|Yes|, yes,| |ye|s|,| ye|s|!"| |cried |Passepartout|.  "|You |have |m|ade a |mistake|
|of| on|e| day|! | We| arrived| tw|enty|-four hours| |ahe|ad of time|;
|but t|h|ere |are o|n|ly t|en |min|utes |left|!"

|Passepartout| |had |se|ized| |h|is m|aster| b|y the |c|ol|lar|,|
|and was |dragging |hi|m| |al|ong| |with |irresistible| force|.

P|hileas Fogg|, |th|us |ki|dna|pped|, with|out hav|ing |time to |th|ink|,|
|l|eft h|is |h|ouse|, jum|ped |in|to a |c|ab, pro|mi|sed |a| |hundred| |pounds|
|to t|he |cabma|n, and|, |h|a|ving |r|un o|ver| t|wo |do|gs and over|turned|
|fi|ve carriages, |reach|ed |the |Reform |Club|.

|The |clock |indic|ated |a qu|arter before |nine| wh|en |he app|ear|ed|
in |the great| sal|oon|.

|Phileas Fogg| had |accomplished the |journey| |rou|nd the |world| |in| |eighty days|!

|Phileas Fogg| had |won h|is |wag|er| of t|wenty| thousand |pounds|!

|Ho|w was |it t|hat| |a m|an| |so |ex|act |and f|a|sti|dio|us| co|uld |h|ave m|ade|
th|is |error| of a| d|ay|?  How |came |he to |thi|nk |that| he ha|d |arrived|
in |Lo|ndon| on| |Saturday, |the t|wenty|-first |day o|f |December|,|
|wh|en it was really |Frida|y|, the |t|went|ieth|, the |seventy-|n|inth day|
|only |from his departure|?

|The c|ause of the |err|or| is |very s|imple|.|

Phileas Fogg| |ha|d, |with|out |suspect|ing |it, gai|ned one day| |on his |journ|ey|,
and |th|is |me|rely because |he |had |trave|lled| co|n|st|antly |eastw|ard|; he w|ould|,
o|n t|he co|ntr|ary|, |ha|ve| lost |a |day| h|ad he gone in| the| op|posite direction|,
th|at is|, we|stw|ard.|

|In |journeying ea|st|ward| h|e| had |gone| |towards the s|un, and t|he| d|ays |the|refore|
|di|minished |for |him| |as m|an|y time|s |f|our |minutes| as h|e |c|r|ossed| degre|es|
in |this |di|rect|ion|.  |The|re are| |th|ree hundred and |six|ty| degrees|
|on t|h|e c|ircu|mference| o|f t|he e|arth|; and| the|se| |t|hree hundred and |six|ty| |degrees|,
|mu|ltipl|ied |by f|our minutes|, g|i|ves| |precise|ly |tw|ent|y|-f|our hours|--that is|,
the| |day un|conscious|ly |g|ained|.|  |In other word|s|, |wh|i|le P|hileas Fogg|,
g|oing eastward|, |sa|w th|e s|un |pa|ss| the |me|ridian| e|ighty| t|imes|,
his |f|riends i|n |London| only s|aw i|t pass| th|e |me|r|idian| s|e|ve|nty|-nine| times|.
|Th|is |is w|hy |the|y awa|ited |hi|m at |th|e |Reform| Club| on |Saturday,|
and |no|t |S|unday, |a|s |Mr. Fogg |th|ought|.

|An|d |Passepartout|'s |fam|ous |family wa|tch|, |which had a|lways |k|ept |London| time|,
|w|ould |have |be|trayed |this |fact|, |if |it had |ma|rked t|he |days |as |well| as|
|the| hours| |a|nd th|e m|inutes|!

|Phileas Fogg|, |then,| |ha|d won| the |twenty| thousand |pounds|; |but|,|
a|s he |had |spe|nt nearly |n|ine|teen |thousand| |on the |wa|y,| th|e |pe|c|uni|ary
|ga|in w|as |s|mall|.  |His |object was|, how|ever, |to| be |victor|ious,
|and |not t|o |win |money|.  |H|e |di|vided th|e o|ne th|ousand pounds|
that |remained |between |Passepartout| |and the |un|fortunate| Fix|,
|against w|hom he |cheri|shed no| |gr|udge.  He |d|educt|ed|, however,|
f|rom |Passepartout|'s |s|ha|re |the c|ost| of |the g|as| wh|ich |had |b|ur|ned|
|in |his r|oom f|or n|ine|teen hundred| and |twenty| hours|,|
|for |t|he s|ak|e of |regula|ri|ty|.|

|Th|at evening|, |Mr. Fogg|, |as tra|n|quil| and| p|hl|egm|atic| a|s e|ver,|
sa|id t|o |Aouda|: "|Is |our ma|rriage| s|t|ill a|gree|able| |to you|?"

"|M|r. Fogg|,|" |re|plied she, |"|it is |for| m|e t|o ask that| question|.|
|You| |w|ere |ruin|ed|, |but |no|w |you a|re |r|i|ch| again|."

|"|Par|don |m|e, madam|; my |f|ortune| |be|longs| to you|.  |If |you| |had not|
|sugge|sted our m|arriage, |my servant |would| n|ot |have |gone to|
|th|e |Rev|erend| |Samuel |Wil|son|'s, |I |sh|ould |n|ot| have| |been |a|pp|r|ised|
|of |my e|rror|, a|nd--|"

"|Dear |Mr. |Fogg|!" |said |the |young woman|.|

"|D|ea|r |Aouda|!" |replied| |P|hileas Fogg|.

|It |need no|t be| |sa|id |that |the |ma|rr|iage |took p|lace |for|ty|-eight |ho|urs| |after|,
and that |Passepartout|, |gl|owing and |d|azz|li|ng|,| |gave the |br|i|de away|.
|Had |he n|ot s|aved |her, |and |was |he| n|o|t |en|titled to |th|is |honou|r?
|
|Th|e |next day|, |as so|on |as |it was light,| Passepartout| |rapped
|vigorous|ly| a|t |his master|'s |door|.  Mr. Fogg |ope|ned| |it|, and| |as|ked|,
|"|What|'s the matter|, |Passepartout|?"

"|W|hat| is| it|, sir|?  |Wh|y, I|'ve| |just |th|is |in|stant| f|ound |ou|t|--"

|"|What|?"

"|Th|at| w|e might h|ave| |made the tour| of the world |in |only |s|eve|nty-|eight |days|."

"|No| doubt," |re|turned |Mr. Fogg|, |"|by not |c|ross|ing India|.  |But |i|f|
I |had no|t |c|ross|ed India|, I |should n|ot| |have| |saved |Aouda|;
|s|he would n|ot| have |been |my| wife|, and--"

|Mr. |F|ogg| |quietly| s|hut| the| door|.

|Phileas Fogg| had| won| h|is |wag|er|, |and |had |made h|is |journ|ey|
around the w|orld| in |eighty days|.  |T|o do |th|is| h|e had empl|oyed|
|eve|ry me|an|s of conveyance|--steamer|s|, |railway|s, |c|ar|riages|, |yachts,
t|ra|ding|-|vessel|s|, |sledg|es|, |elephants|.  The| |ecce|ntric gentleman|
|had |thr|oughout| d|is|played |all h|is m|arv|ellou|s |qu|a|lit|ies of |c|oolness
and |ex|act|itude.|  |But| w|hat |th|en|?  |W|hat had h|e |r|eal|ly| g|ained by |all
th|is tr|ouble?  W|hat had he |broug|ht| b|ack |from th|is |long |and w|eary |journey|?

|Nothing|, s|ay| you|?|  |Perhaps |so|; |no|thing| |b|ut a| c|h|ar|ming| woman,|
